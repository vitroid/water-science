    <h2><a name="vapor" id="vapor"></a>Water vapor </h2>
    <p>Water vapor is an odorless, transparent, invisible gas that exists in the air over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. What is commonly known as steam (see right) are condensed liquid water droplets suspended in the air (i.e., an aerosol of colloidal particles similar to those carbon particles occurring in smoke). Water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into clouds of tiny liquid droplets that scatter light and may precipitate. Water has a very low vapor pressure for its molecular weight and so does not <a href="phase_anomalies.html#BPt">boil</a> until the relatively high temperature of 100&nbsp;&deg;C at 101.325 k<a href="constants.html#Pa">Pa.</a> It takes much<a href="thermodynamic_anomalies.html#vap"> energy to boil </a>and <a href="density_anomalies.html#steam">increases its volume by 1700 times</a>. Most of the water vapor in the air is derived from evaporation from the sea, mainly tropical seas, with an <a href="http://www.iapws.org/relguide/SeaAir.pdf"  title="opens new site in a pop-up window"  target="otherWin5" onclick="newWin('otherWin5')">Equation of State for Humid Air in Contact with Seawater</a> described  [<a  href="ref43.html#r4268" name="r4268" title="go to cited reference" id="r4268">4268</a>]. Surface temperature and  wind speeds play key roles. The water vapor saturation over ice is less than over a water surface at the same temperature.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At sufficiently high temperatures or low pressures all particles in a gas phase obey the <strong>Ideal Gas Law<sup><a title="click for the original paper" href="#d">d</a><a name="bd" id="bd"></a></sup></strong> where   no forces are exerted between the gas particles.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Gaseous  water is water vapor and one of the lightest of gases. In science and  engineering, the word 'steam' is also used for water vapor (i.e., gaseous  water), but usually when above the boiling point of water. As commonly used in  the English language, 'steam' also may mean the white cloud of fine liquid  water droplets of condensed water vapor produced by a boiling kettle or fumaroles  (see top right). When water is heated in a pan, air molecules are driven out of  the solution and gather crevices on the pan's surface. These air bubbles grow  and are released until most atmospheric molecules are released. This bubbling  indicates that the water is heating but does not indicate that steam is formed.  Boiling is initiated at about 100&nbsp;&deg;C, at normal atmospheric pressure, by  the formation of small vapor-filled voids which increase in size, merge, and produce  gaseous bubbles containing water molecules (steam). Initially, these are at  higher than atmospheric pressure. Then, the pressure reduces, and these bubbles  collapse in the cooler water as they rise, making a popping noise. When the  water is hot, these bubbles grow and rise before bursting at the liquid's  surface to give steam. Further heating results in a lesser popping noise as most of the bubbles reach the surface and the water is fully boiling. Evaporation is different from boiling as it only occurs  at the surface of the liquids, whereas boiling can occur throughout the liquid.  Boiling water for a minute kills most microorganisms and viruses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Water vapor is transparent to 'visible' light but absorbs strongly in the infrared. It is the main absorber of the sunlight in  the atmosphere; without it, the Earth would be in a permanent ice age. The mechanisms through which water vapor in the lower troposphere (at temperatures up to around  the triple point of water; &asymp;  0.01&nbsp;&deg;C, &asymp; 5 km) influences convection, circulation and the formation of clouds, have been reviewed [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3139">3139</a><a name="r3139" id="r3139"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The 13 <a href="constants.html#trillion">trillion</a> tons of water in the atmosphere (&asymp; 0.33% by weight) is responsible  for about 70% of all atmospheric absorption of radiation, mainly in the  infrared region where water shows strong absorption. Atmospheric water  contributes substantially to the greenhouse effect, more than twice that of  carbon dioxide, ensuring a warm habitable planet, but operates a negative  feedback effect due to cloud formation reflecting the sunlight away. Molecular rotations and vibrations are obtained using the spectroscopic data and summarized for all  water's isotopologues by <abbr title = "International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry">IUPAC</abbr> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3035">3035</a><a name="r3035" id="r"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As with other gases, gaseous water is not an ideal gas, although it behaves nearly as an ideal gas at low densities, approximately obeying the relationship (the equation of state, EoS),</p>

    <p>The second virial coefficient (B) depends on temperature. Except at high densities, the higher virial coefficients (C, D, etc.,) are usually ignored (i.e., they are put equal to zero). It can be seen right that the second virial coefficient increases considerably at  lower temperatures [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3034">3034</a><a name="r3034" id="r3034"></a>]. This indicates more  significant  deviations from ideal behavior at lower temperatures  partially due to <a href="water_dimer.html" title="go for more information" >dimer formation</a> (shown blue right [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3037">3037</a><a name="r30367" id="r3037"></a>]).

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Hydrogen-bonding between  water molecules occurs in the gas phase with, typically within the ambient  atmosphere, over one water dimer forming for every thousand free water  molecules rising to about one in twenty in steam. The dimer formation, and the order it brings are a  major cause for the large deviations from ideal gas behavior in gaseous water and are particularly relevant at higher pressures.</p>

    <p>The thermodynamic properties of gaseous water above 100&nbsp;&deg;C, 101,325 Pa, are described by <span class="style6"><a href="http://www.iapws.org/relguide/IF97-Rev.pdf">The International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (<abbr title = "International Assosiation for the Properties of Water and Steam">IAPWS</abbr>)</a></span>. Another analytical representation of the ideal-gas Gibbs free energy for water has been developed based on the molecular structure of water and using just six molecular constants  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref43.html#r4280">4280</a><a name="r4280" id="r4280"></a>].

    <h2><a name="air" id="air"></a>Airborne water</h2>
    <p>When we breathe out, we may exhale moist air, <sup><a title="click for the original paper" href="#e">e</a><a name="be" id="be"></a></sup> visible water droplets, and an aerosol of invisible (nm - &micro;+ radius) water droplets. This water vapor increases the <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#l">humidity</a> of the air. This aerosol might not be visible but may be detected by a water-cluster-detecting breath sensor developed for detecting drunk or drowsy drivers [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1801">1801</a><a name="r1801" id="r1801"></a>]. Aerosol droplets can also be produced by flushing a toilet. These respiratory droplets, produced by talking, coughing, and sneezing, may contain viral, fungal, and bacterial pathogens, and transmit infectious diseases, such as influenza, <abbr title = "Coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, colds (adenoviruses, rhinoviruses), pneumonia, tonsillitis, scarlet fever, and meningitis  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4134">4134</a>a<a name="r4134" id="r4134"></a>]. Normal talking may produce over 100  particles per second (containing 10<sup>5</sup> - 10<sup>8</sup> virus particles per milliliter), some of which remain airborne for several minutes. As the sedimentation time is inversely proportional to the square of the droplet size, in the absence of evaporation, a 200 &micro;m diameter droplet drops at 1 m &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup> whereas a 2 &micro;m diameter droplet drops at 0.1 mm &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>. These drop velocities are much smaller if evaporation is taken into account, which is more important at lower <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#l">relative humidity</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Just a few individuals may disseminate and disperse the majority of infectious particles. Tiny droplets (&lt; 5 &micro;m including nanodroplets produced in building ventilation, air conditioners, cruise liners, and aircraft, for example) may stay air-bound for over a week. Indoors, even large droplets (up to 100 &micro;m) may stay air-bound for much longer periods due to the restricted (sometimes upwards) indoor air circulation and, even if they fall, they may become airborne again once they dry out (desiccate) or land on touchable surfaces, like doorknobs, buttons, and tabletops. Whether infected droplets remain infectious depends on the environment, the infectious dose, and the pathogen.    Virus survival  depends on the temperature with low temperatures (e.g., ~8&nbsp;&deg;C), giving the greatest viral survival. Generally, bacteria are more resistant to higher temperatures than viruses. Influenza is most transmissible (infectious) under cold, dry conditions with high humidity  leading to its inactivation after coughing [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4159">4159</a><a name="r4159" id="r4159"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Even though there are more colds and flu, etc., in the cold season (winter in the northern hemisphere), there does not seem to be a strong connection of the pathogen spread to temperature; despite this strong correlation. In  winter, heating the buildings, particularly central heating, dries the cold air  coming in from outside, causing the relative humidity to drop.  However, relative humidity affects the stability of viruses in aerosols. Heating  the buildings in winter, particularly central heating, dries the cold air coming in from outside, causing the relative humidity to  drop.  The presence of the occupants may not be sufficient to raise the indoor humidity [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4137">4137</a><a name="r4137" id="r3"></a>]. As a result, indoor relative humidity in temperate regions typically varies between 10% and 40% in the winter months, which is significantly lower compared  with its range of 40% to 60% in the summer months [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4134">4134</a>b]. For example, if air enters at 10&nbsp;&deg;C and 70% relative humidity and is warmed to 20&nbsp;&deg;C, its relative humidity drops to 37%. The stability and infectivity of winter viruses trapped in those droplets show a striking correlation with low relative humidity. At  low relative humidity, the droplets dry out to leave the pathogens suspended for much longer within much smaller droplets in the air. Also, dry  air dries out the mucous membranes in the nose, which eases the invasion of infectious  viruses into the respiratory tract. Subjects with a natural tendency to dry respiratory mucosa are particularly vulnerable to the Covid-19 virus, as the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract are required to present the first essential barrier against Covid-19 virus infection. Also, dry respiratory mucosa correlates with age, leaving the elderly more prone to infection. Further, dry nasal mucosa correlates with loss of smell and taste [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4138">4138</a><a name="r4138" id="r4138"></a>], and loss of smell and taste are indicative of  Covid-19 infection.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The improved stability (and infectivity) of <abbr title = "Severe acute respiratory syndrome">SARS</abbr> coronavirus at low temperatures and low humidity environments has been reported to facilitate its transmission  in subtropical areas (such as Hong Kong and Guangzhou) during the spring and within air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical areas (such as Malaysia, Indonesia, or Thailand) with high temperatures and high relative humidity environments did not have major community outbreaks of SARS [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4135">4135</a>a<a name="r4135" id="r4135"></a>]. Similar findings,  from 166 countries, provide evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic may be partially suppressed with  humidity increases  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4135">4135</a>b]. Within our housing,  air humidity negatively correlates with Covid-19 morbidity and mortality [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4137">4137</a>].</p>

    <p>An interesting effect (the <a href="https://www.wiley.com/college/phy/halliday320005/pdf/leidenfrost_essay.pdf" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin25" onclick="newWin('otherWin25')">Leidenfrost effect</a>, <sup><a title="click for the original paper" href="#f">a</a><a name="bf" id="bf"></a></sup> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2291">2291</a><a name="r2291" id="r2291"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2771">2771</a><a name="r2771" id="r2771"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3649">3649</a><a name="r3649" id="r3649"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref44.html#r4319">4319</a><a name="r4319" id="r4319"></a>] see right) is that liquid water 
      droplets remain far longer on a hot plate  (up to 5000 times as long) just above 200&nbsp;&deg;C 
      than if the hot plate was just above 100&nbsp;&deg;C. The temperature at which this (the temperature boundary between the surfacel-iquid heating and film boiling regimes) occurs depends on the surface material and its roughness (and the liquid involved as the Leidenfrost  effect is a general one for all liquids) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref45.html#r4425">4425</a><a name="r4425" id="r4425"></a>]. Once formed, the droplets move around the surface in a rapid motion. See [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref10.html#r960">960</a><a name="r960" id="r960"></a>] 
      for an amusing scientific answer to how water boils. The Leidenfrost effect is not superheating but due to the formation of an insulating vapor layer keeping that liquid from boiling rapidly. The water droplet's temperatures remain at about 90&nbsp;&deg;C when the plate is held at about 300&nbsp;&deg;C.  For drop radii of<br />
      a few millimeters,  the vapor thickness is about 100 &mu;m. During the final stage of evaporation, the droplet takes off from the surface., unless any surface contamination bridges the vapor layer and causes it to explode   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref45.html#r4428">4428</a><a name="r4428" id="r4428"></a>]</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>The droplet's rapid motion arises from an asymmetry in the vapor profile  [<a name="r3485" id="r3485"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3485">3485</a>]. If the hotplate surface is made<a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#super"> superhydrophobic</a>,  the droplets remain even at lower temperatures (down to 22&nbsp;&deg;C)  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1926">1926</a><a name="r1926" id="r1926"></a>]. On heated, curved surfaces, larger quantities of fluid, not just droplets, can be suspended [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1957">1957</a><a name="r1957" id="r1957"></a>]. If placed in an electric field, Leidenfrost droplets  jump from the hot surface  higher and higher [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2881">2881</a><a name="r2881" id="r2881"></a>]. The Leidenfrost effect has been used in nano-synthetic reactions to enable faster reaction rates. They  may also be involved in sphere-in-cavity structures with residual drag  coefficients less than 10% of solid objects of similar dimensions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3118">3118</a><a name="r3118" id="r3118"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A similar effect (the three-phase Leidenfrost effect) occurs with solid water (hexagonal ice) on a heated surface. However, this takes place at a much higher temperature   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref45.html#r4419">4419</a><a name="r4419" id="r4418"></a>]. Both liquid and vapor film layers are found under the levitating ice. As this Leidenfrost effect does not start until the temperature is raised above 550&nbsp;&deg;C (on smooth aluminum), there is much better heat transfer than  liquid water at lower temperatures (150&nbsp;&deg;C - 550&nbsp;&deg;C). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Another triple Leidenfrost effect has been described where drops of different liquids collide above a hot plate,  bouncing several times before finally coalescing [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref45.html#r4420">4420</a><a name="r4420" id="r4420"></a>]. The drops are not only in a Leidenfrost state with respect to the hot surface, but they  also experience a Leidenfrost effect between them at the moment of collision.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is an inverse Leidenfrost effect where hotter droplets (at room temperature) levitate above a very cold liquid, such as liquid nitrogen, at &minus;196 &deg;C [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref45.html#r4427">4427</a><a name="r4427" id="r4427"></a>]. In this case, the droplets cause the cold liquid to evaporate by creating the repulsive cushion of vapor. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Self-organized hexagonally-patterned microdroplets (&asymp;  10 &micro;m - 50 &micro;m diameter) clusters have been  found floating, as a single sheet, a dozen or so micrometers above  locally-heated water  (and other hydrogen-bonded liquids') surfaces [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3331">3331</a><a name="r3331" id="r3331"></a>]. These flat levitating clusters of self-assembled ordered spherical droplets (see right) are formed by condensation of vapor above the locally (infrared or laser irradiated) heated water surfaces. They can be formed even at maximum surface temperatures as low as  27.6&nbsp;&deg;C.
      They are separated from each other and levitated above the liquid surface by about the droplet diameters. Their levitation is due to the dynamic balance between the evaporation and condensation balance for both  water in the droplets and for the steam-air gas mixture around the droplets. Their organized array is due to the minimization of the entropy of the arrangement. The collapse of one droplet causes the collapse of all the droplets. Infrared irradiation of a droplet cluster prevents the coalescence of the cluster [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3961">3961</a><a name="r3961" id="r2"></a>]. Others have found that the droplets may demonstrate 4-fold, 5-fold, and 7-fold symmetry  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref43.html#r4236">4236</a><a name="r4236" id="r4236"></a>].</p>
