  <center><h1> <font face="Arial">The use of enzymes in starch hydrolysis</font></h1></center>
  <p><font face="Arial">Starch is the commonest storage carbohydrate in plants. It
    is used by the plants themselves, by microbes and by higher organisms so there
    is a great diversity of enzymes able to catalyse its hydrolysis. Starch from all
    plant sources occurs in the form of granules which differ markedly in size and
    physical characteristics from species to species. Chemical differences are less
    marked. The major difference is the ratio of amylose to amylopectin; e.g., corn
    starch from waxy maize contains only 2% amylose but that from amylomaize is
    about 80% amylose. Some starches, for instance from potato, contain covalently
    bound phosphate in small amounts (0.2% approximately), which has significant
    effects on the physical properties of the starch but does not interfere with its
    hydrolysis. Acid hydrolysis of starch has had widespread use in the past. It is
    now largely replaced by enzymic processes, as it required the use of corrosion
    resistant materials, gave rise to high colour and saltash content (after
    neutralisation), needed more energy for heating and was relatively difficult to
    control.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><a name="fig4_2"></a><b>Figure 4.2. </b> The use of enzymes in processing starch.
Typical conditions are given.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial">Of the two components of starch, amylopectin presents the
great challenge to hydrolytic enzyme systems. This is due to the residues
involved in </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-1,6-glycosidic branch points which constitute about
4 - 6% of the
glucose present. Most hydrolytic enzymes are specific for </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-1,4-glucosidic links
yet the </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-1,6-glucosidic links must also be cleaved for complete hydrolysis of
amylopectin to glucose. Some of the most impressive recent exercises in the
development of new enzymes have concerned debranching enzymes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It is necessary to hydrolyse starch in a wide variety of
processes which m be condensed into two basic classes:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">processes in which
the starch hydrolysate is to be used by microbes or man, and</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">processes in
which it is necessary to eliminate starch.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial">In the former processes, such as glucose syrup production,
starch is usually the major component of reaction mixtures, whereas in the
latter processes, such as the processing of sugar cane juice, small amounts of
starch which contaminate non-starchy materials are removed. Enzymes of various
types are used in these processes. Although starches from diverse plants may be
utilised, corn is the world's most abundant source and provides most of the
substrate used in the preparation of starch hydrolysates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There are three stages in the conversion of starch (<a href="starch.html#fig4_2">Figure
4.2</a>):</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">gelatinisation, involving the dissolution of the nanogram-sized starch
granules to form a viscous suspension;&nbsp;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial"> liquefaction, involving the partial
hydrolysis of the starch, with concomitant loss in viscosity; and</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">saccharification, involving the production of glucose and maltose by further
hydrolysis.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial">&nbsp;Gelatinisation is achieved by heating starch with water, and occurs
necessarily and naturally when starchy foods are cooked. Gelatinised starch is
readily liquefied by partial hydrolysis with enzymes or acids and saccharified
by further acidic or enzymic hydrolysis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The starch and glucose syrup industry uses the expression
dextrose equivalent or DE, similar in definition to the DH units of proteolysis,
to describe its products, where:</font></p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/starch3.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="DE= 100 x Number of glycosidic bonds cleaved/(Initial number of glycosidic bonds present)" width="388" height="48">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial">(4 .2)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In practice, this is usually determined analytically by
use of the closely related, but not identical, expression:</font></p>
<p align="center"><a name="4_3"></a><img src="images/starch4.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="DE= 100 x ( Reducing sugar, expressed as glucose )/( Total carbohydrate)" width="368" height="48">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial">(4 .3)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Thus, DE represents the percentage hydrolysis of the
glycosidic linkages present. Pure glucose has a DE of 100, pure maltose has a DE
of about 50 (depending upon the analytical methods used; see equation (<a href="starch.html#4_3">4.3</a>)) and
starch has a DE of effectively zero. During starch hydrolysis, DE indicates the
extent to which the starch has been cleaved. Acid hydrolysis of starch has long
been used to produce 'glucose syrups' and even crystalline glucose (dextrose
monohydrate). Very considerable amounts of 42 DE syrups are produced using acid
and are used in many applications in confectionery. Further hydrolysis using
acid is not satisfactory because of undesirably coloured and flavoured breakdown
products. Acid hydrolysis appears to be a totally random process which is not
influenced by the presence of </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-1,6-glucosidic linkages.</font></p>

<hr>
<p><font face="Arial">The nomenclature of the enzymes used commercially for
starch hydrolysis is somewhat confusing and the EC numbers sometimes lump
together enzymes with subtly different activities (<a href="starch.html#tab4_2">Table 4.2</a>). For example,
</font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylase may be subclassified as liquefying or saccharifying amylases but even
this classification is inadequate to encompass all the enzymes that are used in
commercial starch hydrolysis. One reason for the confusion in the nomenclature
is the use of the anomeric form of the released reducing group in the product
rather than that of the bond being hydrolysed; the products of bacterial and
fungal </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylases are in the </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-configuration and the products of </font><font face="symbol">b</font><font face="arial">-amylases are
in the </font><font face="symbol">b</font><font face="arial">-configuration, although all these enzymes cleave between </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-1,4-linked
glucose residues.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylases (1,4-</font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-D-glucan glucanohydrolases) are
endohydrolases which cleave 1,4-</font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-D-glucosidic bonds and can bypass but cannot
hydrolyse 1,6-</font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-D-glucosidic branchpoints. Commercial enzymes used for the
industrial hydrolysis of starch are produced by <i> Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i>
(supplied by various manufacturers) and by <i> B. licheniformis</i> (supplied by Novo
Industri A/S as Termamyl). They differ principally in their tolerance of high
temperatures, Termamyl retaining more activity at up to 110°C, in the presence
of starch, than the <i> B. amyloliquefaciens</i> </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylase. The maximum DE obtainable
using bacterial </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylases is around 40 but prolonged treatment leads to the
formation of maltulose (4-</font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-D-glucopyranosyl-D-fructose), which is resistant to
hydrolysis by glucoamylase and </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylases. DE values of 8-12 are
used in most commercial processes where
further saccharification is to occur. The principal
requirement for liquefaction to this extent is to reduce the viscosity of the
gelatinised starch to ease subsequent processing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Various manufacturers use different approaches to starch
liquefaction using </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylases but the principles are the same. Granular starch
is slurried at 30-40% (w/w) with cold water, at pH 6.0-6.5, containing 20-80 ppm
Ca<sup>2+</sup> (which stabilises and activates the enzyme) and the enzyme is added (via a
metering pump). The </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylase is usually supplied at high activities so that the
enzyme dose is 0.5-0.6 kg tonne<sup>&minus;1</sup> (about 1500 U kg<sup>&minus;1</sup> dry matter) of starch. When
Termamyl is used, the slurry of starch plus enzyme is pumped continuously
through a jet cooker, which is heated to 105°C using live steam. Gelatinisation
occurs very rapidly and the enzymic activity, combined with the significant
shear forces, begins the hydrolysis. The residence time in the jet cooker is
very brief. The partly gelatinised starch is passed into a series of holding
tubes maintained at 100-105°C and held for 5 min to complete the gelatinisation
process. Hydrolysis to the required DE is completed in holding tanks at
90-100°C for 1 to 2 h. These tanks contain baffles to discourage backmixing.
Similar processes may be used with <i> B. amyloliquefaciens</i> </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylase but the
maximum temperature of 95°C must not be exceeded. This has the drawback that a
final 'cooking' stage must be introduced when the required DE has been attained
in order to gelatinise the recalcitrant starch grains present in some types of
starch which would otherwise cause cloudiness in solutions of the final product.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The liquefied starch is usually saccharified but
comparatively small amounts are spray-dried for sale as 'maltodextrins' to the
food industry mainly for use as bulking agents and in baby food. In this case,
residual enzymic activity may be destroyed by lowering the pH towards the end of
the heating period.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Fungal </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylase also finds use in the baking industry. It
often needs to be added to bread-making flours to promote adequate gas
production and starch modification during fermentation. This has become
necessary since the introduction of combine harvesters. They reduce the time
between cutting and threshing of the wheat, which previously was sufficient to
allow a limited sprouting so increasing the amounts of endogenous enzymes. The
fungal enzymes are used rather than those from bacteria as their action is
easier to control due to their relative heat lability, denaturing rapidly during
baking.</font></p>
