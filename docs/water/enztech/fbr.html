<p align="left"><font face="Arial"> These reactors
  generally behave in a manner intermediate between CSTRs and PBRs. They consist
  of a bed of immobilised enzyme which is fluidised by the rapid upwards flow of
  the substrate stream alone or in combination with a gas or secondary liquid
  stream, either of which may be inert or contain material relevant to the
  reaction. A gas stream is usually preferred as it does not dilute the product
  stream. There is a minimum fluidisation velocity needed to achieve bed
  expansion, which depends upon the size, shape, porosity and density of the
  particles and the density and viscosity of the liquid. This minimum fluidisation
  velocity is generally fairly low (about 0.2 -I.0 cm s<sup>&minus;1</sup>) as most immobilised-enzyme particles have densities close to that of the bulk liquid. In this case
  the relative bed expansion is proportional to the superficial gas velocity and
  inversely proportional to the square root of the reactor diameter. Fluidising
  the bed requires a large power input but, once fluidised, there is little
  further energetic input needed to increase the flow rate of the substrate stream
  through the reactor (<a href="continuous.html#fig5_3">Figure 5.3</a>). At high flow rates and low reactor diameters
  almost ideal plug -flow characteristics may be achieved. However, the kinetic
  performance of the FBR normally lies between that of the PBR and the CSTR, as
  the small fluid linear velocities allowed by most biocatalytic particles causes
  a degree of back-mixing that is often substantial, although never total. The
  actual design of the FBR will determine whether it behaves in a manner that is
  closer to that of a PBR or CSTR (see <a href="cstr.html#fig5_5"> Figures 5.5
    -5.9</a>). It can, for example, be
  made to behave in a manner very similar to that of a PBR, if it is baffled in
  such a way that substantial backmixing is avoided. FBRs are chosen when these
  intermediate characteristics are required, e.g., where a high conversion is
  needed but the substrate stream is colloidal or the reaction produces a
  substantial pH change or heat output. They are particularly useful if the
  reaction involves the utilisation or release of gaseous material.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The FBR is normally used with fairly small
immobilised enzyme particles (20-40 </font><font face="Symbol">m</font><font face="Arial">m diameter) in order to achieve a high
catalytic surface area. These particles must be sufficiently dense, relative to
the substrate stream, that they are not swept out of the reactor. Less-dense
particles must be somewhat larger. For efficient operation the particles should
be of nearly uniform size otherwise a non-uniform biocatalytic concentration
gradient will be formed up the reactor. FBRs are usually tapered outwards at the
exit to allow for a wide range of flow rates. Very high flow rates are avoided
as they cause channelling and catalyst loss. The major disadvantage of
development of FBR process is the difficulty in scaling-up these reactors. PBRs
allow scale-up factors of greater than 50000 but, because of the markedly
different fluidisation characteristics of different sized reactors, FBRs can
only be scaled-up by a factor of 10 -100 each time. In addition, changes in the
flow rate of the substrate stream causes complex changes in the flow pattern
within these reactors that may have consequent unexpected effects upon the
conversion rate.</font></p>
