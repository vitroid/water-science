  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The amount of enzyme
    present or used in a process is difficult to determine in absolute terms (e.g., grams), as its purity is often low and a proportion may be in an inactive, or
    partially active, state. More relevant parameters are the activity of the enzyme
    preparation and the activities of any contaminating enzymes. These activities
    are usually measured in terms of the activity unit (<B>U</B>) which is
    defined as the amount which will catalyse the transformation of 1 micromole of
    the substrate per minute under standard conditions. Typically, this represents
    10<sup>&minus;6</sup> - 10<sup>&minus;11</sup> Kg for pure enzymes and 10<sup>&minus;4</sup> -
    10<sup>&minus;7</sup> Kg for industrial enzyme preparations. Another unit of enzyme
    activity has been recommended. This is the <B>katal</B>
    (<B>kat</B>) which is defined as the amount which will catalyse the
    transformation of one mole of substance per second (1 kat = 60 000 000 U). It is
    an impracticable unit and has not yet received widespread acceptance. Sometimes
    non-standard activity units are used, such as Soxhet, Anson and Kilo Novo units,
    which are based on physical changes such as lowering viscosity and supposedly
    better understood by industry. Rightfully, such units are gradually falling into
    disuse. The activity is a measure of enzyme content that is clearly of major
    interest when the enzyme is to be used in a process. For this reason, enzymes
    are usually marketed in terms of activity rather than weight. The specific
    activity (e.g., U Kg<sup>&minus;1</sup>) is a parameter of interest, some utility as an
    index of purity but lesser importance. There is a major problem with these
    definitions of activity; the rather vague notion of &quot;standard
    conditions&quot;. These are meant to refer to optimal conditions, especially
    with regard to pH, ionic strength, temperature, substrate concentration and the
    presence and concentration of cofactors and coenzymes. However, these so-termed
    optimal conditions vary both between laboratories and between suppliers. They
    also depend on the particular application in which the enzyme is to be used.
    Additionally, preparations of the same notional specific activity may differ
    with respect to stability and be capable of very different total catalytic
  <B>productivity</B> (this is the total substrate converted to product
    during the lifetime of the catalyst, under specified conditions). Conditions for
    maximum initial activity are not necessarily those for maximum stability. Great
    care has to be taken over the consideration of these factors when the most
    efficient catalyst for a particular purpose is to be chosen</font></p>
