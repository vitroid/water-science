<p align="left"><font face="Arial">This reactor consists of a well -stirred tank
  containing the enzyme, which is normally immobilised. The substrate stream is
  continuously pumped into the reactor at the same time as the product stream is
  removed. If the reactor is behaving in an ideal manner, there is total
  back-mixing and the product stream is identical with the liquid phase within the
  reactor and invariant with respect to time. Some molecules of substrate may be
  removed rapidly from the reactor, whereas others may remain for substantial
  periods. The distribution of residence times for molecules in the substrate
  stream is shown in <a href="#fig5_4"> Figure 5.4</a>.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The CSTR is an easily constructed, versatile
and cheap reactor, which allows simple catalyst charging and replacement. Its
well -mixed nature permits straightforward control over the temperature and pH
of the reaction and the supply or removal of gases. CSTRs tend to be rather
large as the: need to be efficiently mixed. Their volumes are usually about five
to ten time the volume of the contained immobilised enzyme. This, however, has
the advantage that there is very little resistance to the flow of the substrate
stream, which may contain colloidal or insoluble substrates, so long as the
insoluble particles are not able to sweep the immobilised enzyme from the
reactor. The mechanical nature of the stirring limits the supports for the
immobilised enzymes to materials which do not easily disintegrate to give 'fines' which may enter the product stream. However, fairly small particle (down
to about 10 </font><font face="Symbol">m</font><font face="Arial">m diameter) may be used, if they are sufficiently dense to stay
within the reactor. This minimises problems due to diffusional resistance.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">An ideal CSTR has complete back -mixing
resulting in a minimisation of the substrate concentration, and a maximisation
of the product concentration, relative to the final conversion, at every point
within the reactor the effectiveness factor being uniform throughout. Thus,
CSTRs are the preferred reactors, everything else being equal, for processes
involving substrate inhibition or product activation. They are also useful where
the substrate stream contains an enzyme inhibitor, as it is diluted within the
reactor. This effect is most noticeable if the inhibitor concentration is
greater than the inhibition constant and [S]<sub>0</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> is low for competitive
inhibition or high for uncompetitive inhibition, when the inhibitor dilution has
more effect than the substrate dilution. Deviations from ideal CSTR behaviour
occur when there is a less effective mixing regime and may generally be overcome
by increasing the stirrer speed, decreasing the solution viscosity or
biocatalyst concentration or by more effective reactor baffling.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The rate of reaction within a CSTR can be
derived from a simple mass balance to be the flow rate (F) times the difference
in substrate concentration between the reactor inlet and outlet. Hence:</font></p>

P is assumed, and substrate molecules that have long
residence times are converted into product, the average residence time of the
product being greater than that for the substrate. The composition of the
product stream is identical with that of the liquid phase within the reactor.
This composition may be calculated from the relative areas under the curves and,
in this case, represents a 90% conversion. Under continuous operating conditions
(operating time &gt; 4V/F), the mean residence time within the reactor is V/F.
However, it may be noted from the graph that only a few molecules have a
residence time close to this value (only 7% between 0.9V/F and 1.1 V/F) whereas
20% of the molecules have residence times of less than 0.1 V/F or greater than
2.3V/F. It should be noted that 100% of the molecules in an equivalent ideal PBR
might be expected to have residence times equal to their mean residence time.</font></p>

up as batch reactors until the required degree of conversion is reached, when

involving high conversions but a train of CSTRs may approach the PBR
performance. This train may be a number (greater than three) of reactors
connected in series or a single vessel divided into compartments, in order to
minimise back-mixing CSTRs may be used with soluble rather than immobilised
enzyme if an ultrafiltration membrane is used to separate the reactor output
stream from the reactor contents. This causes a number of process difficulties,
including concentration polarization or inactivation of the enzyme on the
membrane but may be preferable in order to achieve a combined reaction and
