  <p><font face="Arial">There is now a
    considerable choice of materials which can separate proteins on the basis of
    their molecular size. The original cross-linked dextrans (Sephadex G- series,
    Pharmacia Ltd.) and polyacrylamides (Bio-Gel P- series, BioRad Ltd.) are still,
    quite rightly, widely used. Both types are available in a wide range of pore
    sizes and particle size distributions. However, as the pore size increases, for
    use with larger enzymes, these gels become progressively less rigid and
    therefore less suitable for large scale use. Consequently alternative, but
    generally more costly, rigid gel materials have been developed for the
    fractionation of proteins of molecular weight greater than about 75,000. These
    are the cross-linked derivatives of agarose (Sepharose CL and Superose) and
    dextran (Sephacryl S) made by Pharmacia Ltd., the cross-linked polyacrylamide-agarose mixtures
    (Ultrogel AcA) made by LKB Instruments Ltd. and
    the ethylene glycol-methacrylate copolymers (Fractogel HW) made by Toyo Soda
    Company (TSK). These are available in a range of forms capable of fractionating
    enzymes, and other materials, with molecular weights up to 10<sup>8</sup> and at
    high flow rates. Although these gels are described as 'rigid', it should be
    appreciated that this is a relative term. The best gels are significantly
    compressible so scale-up from laboratory sized columns cannot be achieved by
    producing longer columns. Scale-up is achieved by increasing the diameter of
    columns (up to about 1 m diameter) but retaining the small depth. Further
    scale-up is done by connecting such sections in series to produce 'stacks'.
    Extreme care must be taken in packing all gel columns so as to allow even, well
    distributed, flow throughout the gel bed. For the same reason, the end pieces of
    the columns must allow even distribution of material over the whole surface of
    the column. The newer materials are supplied in a pre-swollen state which enable
    their rapid and efficient packing using slight pressure.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Gel exclusion
chromatography invariably causes dilution of the enzyme which must then be
concentrated using one of the methods described earlier.</font></p>
