<p><font face="Arial"><br>
Various intracellular enzymes are used
in significant quantities and must be released from cells and purified (<a href="sources.html#tab2_1">Table
2.1</a>). The amount of energy that must be put into the breakage of cells depends
very much on the type of organism and to some extent on the physiology of the
organism. Some types of cell are broken readily by gentle treatment such as
osmotic shock (e.g., animal cells and some gram-negative bacteria such as
<i>Azotobacter</i> species), while others are highly resistant to
breakage. These include yeasts, green algae, fungal mycelia and some
gram-positive bacteria which have cell wall and membrane structures capable of
resisting internal osmotic pressures of around 20 atmospheres (2 MPa) and
therefore have the strength, weight for weight, of reinforced concrete.
Consequently a variety of cell disruption techniques have been developed
involving solid or liquid shear or cell lysis.
