<p align="left"><font face="Arial">where
k is the kinetic rate constant for the reaction, A is the Arrhenius constant,
also known as the frequency factor, </font><font face="Symbol">D</font><font face="Arial">G<sup>*</sup> is the standard free
energy of activation (kJ M<sup>&minus;1</sup>) which depends on entropic and enthalpic
factors, R is the gas law constant and T is the absolute temperature. Typical
standard free energies of activation (15 - 70 kJ M<sup>&minus;1</sup>) give rise to
increases in rate by factors between 1.2 and 2.5 for every 10°C rise
in temperature. This factor for the increase in the rate of reaction for every
10°C rise in temperature is commonly denoted by the term
<B>Q<sub>10</sub></B> (i.e., in this case, Q<sub>10</sub> is within the
range 1.2 - 2.5). All the rate constants contributing to the catalytic mechanism
will vary independently, causing changes in both K<sub>m</sub> and
V<sub>max</sub>. It follows that, in an exothermic reaction, the reverse reaction
(having a higher activation energy) increases more rapidly with temperature than
the forward reaction. This, not only alters the equilibrium constant (see
equation 1.12), but also reduces the optimum temperature for maximum conversion
as the reaction progresses. The reverse holds for endothermic reactions such as
that of glucose isomerase (see <a href="nomenc.html#1_5"> reaction [1.5]</a>) where the ratio of fructose to
glucose, at equilibrium, increases from 1.00 at 55°C to 1.17 at
80°C.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">In general, it would be preferable to use enzymes at high
temperatures in order to make use of this increased rate of reaction plus the
protection it affords against microbial contamination. Enzymes, however, are
proteins and undergo essentially irreversible <B>denaturation</B>  (i.e..
conformational alteration entailing a loss of biological activity) at
temperatures above those to which they are ordinarily exposed in their natural
environment. These denaturing reactions have standard free energies of
activation of about 200 - 300 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> (Q<sub>10</sub> in the range 6
- 36) which means that, above a critical temperature, there is a rapid rate of
loss of activity (<a href="#Fig1_5">Figure 1.5</a>). The actual loss of activity is the product of
this rate and the duration of incubation (<a href="#Fig1_6">Figure 1.6</a>). It may be due to covalent
changes such as the deamination of asparagine residues or non-covalent changes
such as the rearrangement of the protein chain. Inactivation by heat
denaturation has a profound effect on the enzymes productivity (<a href="#Fig1_7">Figure
1.7</a>).</font></p>

is seen to vary with the process time, which may be determined by other
additional factors (e.g., overhead costs). It is often difficult to get precise
control of the temperature of an enzyme catalysed process and, under these
circumstances, it may be seen that it is prudent to err on the low temperature

<p align="left"> <font face="Arial"> In this simple case, the half-life of the

<p align="left"> <font face="Arial"> Many
enzyme preparations, both free and immobilised, appear to follow this
series-type deactivation scheme. However because reliable and reproducible data
is difficult to obtain, inactivation data should, in general, be assumed to be
rather error-prone. It is not surprising that such data can be made to fit a
model involving four determined parameters (A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>,
k<sub>d1</sub> and k<sub>d2</sub>). Despite this possible reservation, equations
<a href="#eq1_32">
1.32</a> and <a href="#eq1_33"> 1.33</a> remain quite useful and the theory possesses the definite
advantage of simplicity. In some cases the series-type deactivation may be due
to structural microheterogeneity, where the enzyme preparation consists of a
heterogeneous mixture of a large number of closely related structural forms.
These may have been formed during the past history of the enzyme during
preparation and storage due to a number of minor reactions, such as deamidation
of one or two asparagine or glutamine residues, limited proteolysis or
disulphide interchange. Alternatively it may be due to quaternary structure
equilibria or the presence of distinct genetic variants. In any case, the larger
the variability the more apparent will be the series-type inactivation kinetics.
The practical effect of this is that usually k<sub>d1</sub> is apparently much
larger than k<sub>d2</sub> and A<sub>1</sub> is less than unity.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"> 
<font face="Arial"> 
In order to minimise loss of activity on storage, even moderate temperatures should be
avoided. Most enzymes are stable for months if refrigerated (0 - 4°C).
Cooling below 0°C, in the presence of additives (e.g., glycerol) which
prevent freezing, can generally increase this storage stability even further.
Freezing enzyme solutions is best avoided as it often causes denaturation due to
the stress and pH variation caused by ice-crystal formation. The first order
deactivation constants are often significantly lower in the case of
enzyme-substrate, enzyme-inhibitor and enzyme-product complexes which helps to
explain the substantial stabilising effects of suitable ligands, especially at
concentrations where little free enzyme exists (e.g.&nbsp;[S] &gt;&gt; K<sub>m</sub>).
Other factors, such as the presence of thiol anti-oxidants, may improve the
thermal stability in particular cases.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"> 
<font face="Arial"> 
It has been found that the heat
denaturation of enzymes is primarily due to the proteins' interactions with the
aqueous environment. They are generally more stable in concentrated, rather than
dilute, solutions. In a dry or predominantly dehydrated state, they remain
active for considerable periods even at temperatures above 100°C. This
property has great technological significance and is currently being exploited
by the use of organic solvents (see <a href="biphasic2.html"> Chapter 7</a>).</font></p>

<p align="left"> <font face="Arial"> Pressure changes will also affect
enzyme catalysed reactions. Clearly any reaction involving dissolved gases (e.g., oxygenases and decarboxylases) will be particularly affected by the increased
gas solubility at high pressures. The equilibrium position of the reaction will
also be shifted due to any difference in molar volumes between the reactants and
products. However an additional, if rather small, influence is due to the volume
changes which occur during enzymic binding and catalysis. Some enzyme-reactant
mixtures may undergo reductions in volume amounting to up to 50 ml
mole<sup>&minus;1</sup> during reaction due to conformational restrictions and changes
in their hydration. This, in turn, may lead to a doubling of the k<sub>cat</sub>,
and/or a halving in the K<sub>m</sub> for a 1000 fold increase in pressure. The
relative effects on k<sub>cat</sub> and K<sub>m</sub> depend upon the relative
volume changes during binding and the formation of the reaction transition
states.</font></p>
