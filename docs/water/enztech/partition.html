  <p><font face="Arial">The solution lying within a few molecular diameters (</font><font face="symbol">l</font><font face="arial"> 
    10 nm) from the surface of an immobilised enzyme will be influenced by both 
    the charge and hydrophobicity of the surface. Charges are always present on 
    the surface of immobilised enzyme particles due to the amphoteric nature of 
    enzymes. Where these positive and negative charges are not equally balanced, 
    the net charge on the surface exerts a considerable effect over the properties 
    of the microenvironment. This surface charge, easily produced by the use of 
    ion-exchange or similar charged matrices for the immobilisation, repels molecules 
    of similar charge while attracting those possessing opposite charge. The force 
    of attraction or repulsion due to this charge is significant over molecular 
    distances but decays rapidly with the square of the distance from the surface. 
    A partitioning of charged molecules (e.g., substrates and products) occurs between 
    the bulk solution and the microenvironment; molecules of opposite charge to 
    the immobilised enzyme surface being partitioned into the microenvironment, 
    whereas molecules possessing similar charge to the immobilised enzyme surface 
    are expelled, with equal effect, into the bulk solution. The solute partition 
    may be quantified by introduction of the <b>electrostatic partition coefficient</b>

localised substrate concentration needed to half-saturate the enzyme with

<hr>
<p><font face="arial">If the immobilised enzyme contains a number of groups
capable of chelating cations the partition of such cations into the
microenvironment is far greater than that described by the electrostatic
partition coefficient (</font><font face="symbol">j</font><font face="arial">). For example, soluble glucose isomerase needs
a higher concentration of magnesium ions, than those required by the immobilised
enzyme. It also requires the presence of cobalt ions which do not need to be
added to processes involving the immobilised enzyme due to their strong
chelation by the immobilised matrix. A high concentration of ionising groups may
cause a partitioning of gases away from the microenvironment with consequent
effects on their apparent kinetic parameters. It is also a useful method for
protecting oxygen-labile enzymes by 'salting out' the oxygen from the vicinity
of the enzyme. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial">Differential partitioning of the components of redox couples may
have a significant effect on the activity and stability of certain enzymes. For
example, papain is stabilised by the presence of thiols, which act as effective
reducing agents. However, thiols possess partial negative charges at neutral pHs
which causes their expulsion from the microenvironment of papain if it is
immobilised on the negatively charged clay, kaolinite. In effect, the redox
couple involving thiol and uncharged disulphide, which is not partitioned,
becomes more oxidising around this immobilised enzyme. The net effect is a
destabilisation of the immobilised papain relative to the free enzyme. </font></p>

<p><font face="arial"> Partition of hydrogen ions represents an
important case of solute partition. The pH of the microenvironment may differ
considerably from the pH of the bulk solution if hydrogen ions are partitioned
into or out of the immobilised enzyme matrix. The binding of substrate and the
activity of the immobilised enzyme both depend on the local microenvironmental
pH whereas the pH, as measured by a pH meter, always reflects the pH of the
bathing solution. This causes apparent shifts in the behaviour of the kinetic
constants with respect to the solution pH (<a href="partition.html#fig3.8">Figure 3.8</a>). It is quite a simple
process to alter the optimum pH of an immobilised enzyme by 1 - 2 pH units
giving important technological benefits (e.g., allowing operation of a process
away from the optimum pH of the soluble enzyme but at a pH more suited to the
solubility or stability of reactants or products).</font></p>

<p><font face="arial"> In addition to its affect on solute partition, the
localised electrostatic gradient may affect both the K<sub>m</sub> and
V<sub>max</sub> by encouraging or discouraging the intramolecular approach of
charged groups within the enzyme, or enzyme-substrate complex, during binding
and catalysis. A large number of small energetic gains and losses may complicate
the analysis of such overall effects (<a href="partition.html#tab3_4">Table 3.4</a>). As the resultant changes are
also reduced by increases in the ionic strength of the solution, these
electrostatic effects may be difficult to distinguish from the effects of
partition.</font></p>

<p>The changes in k<sub>cat</sub> may be due to the approach of two positively
charged groups during the rate-controlling step in the catalysis</p>
<hr>
<p><font face="arial"> Hydrophobic interactions
play a central role in the structure of lipid membranes and the conformation of
macromolecules including enzymes. They are responsible for the relative
solubility of organic molecules in aqueous and organic solvents. These
interactions involve an ordered rearrangement of water molecules at the approach
of hydrophobic surfaces. The force of attraction between hydrophobic surfaces
decays exponentially with their distance apart, halving every nanometer
separation. These hydrophobic interactions effectively reduce the dielectric
constant of the microenvironment with consequent modification of the acidity
constants of acid and basic groups on the enzymes, substrates, products and
buffers (<a href="partition.html#fig3_9">Figure 3.9</a>). Similar effects may alter the acidity constants of key
substrate binding groups, so affecting the K<sub>m</sub> of the immobilised
enzyme for its substrates. Hydrophobic interactions are unaffected by the ionic
strength or pH of the solution but may be neutralised by the presence of
neighbouring hydrophilic groups where they are sufficient to dominate the
localised structure of the water molecules. Hydrophobic interactions may,
therefore, cause the partition of molecules between the bulk phase and the
microenvironment. If the surface of the immobilised enzyme particles is
predominantly hydrophobic, hydrophobic molecules will partition into the
microenvironment of the enzyme and hydrophilic molecules will be partitioned out
into the bathing solution. The reverse case holds if the biocatalytic surface is
hydrophilic. Partition causes changes in the local concentration of the
molecules which, in turn, affects the apparent kinetic constants of the enzyme
in a similar manner to that described for immobilised enzyme particles
possessing a net charge. An example of this effect is the reduction in the
K<sub>m</sub> of immobilised alcohol dehydrogenase for butanol. If the support is
polyacrylamide the K<sub>m</sub> is 0.1 mM but if the more hydrophobic copolymer
of methacrylate with acrylamide is used as the support, the K<sub>m</sub> is
reduced to 0.025 mM. In this example, no difference is noticed in the apparent
values for K<sub>m</sub> using ethanol, a more hydrophilic substrate. A similar
effect may be seen in the case of competitive inhibitors (<a href="partition.html#tab3_5">Table
3.5</a>). Gases
partitioned out from the microenvironment by the presence of a charged support (e.g., oxygen) are generally partitioned into the microenvironment by hydrophobic
supports</font></p>
