  <p><font face="Arial">Enzyme preparations that have been
    clarified and concentrated are now in a suitable state for further purification
    by chromatography. For enzyme purification there are three principal types of
    chromatography utilising the ion-exchange, affinity and gel exclusion properties
    of the enzyme, usually in that order. Ion-exchange and affinity chromatographic
    methods can both rapidly handle large quantities of crude enzyme but
    ion-exchange materials are generally cheaper and, therefore, preferred at an
    earlier stage in the purification where the scale of operation is somewhat
    greater. Gel exclusion chromatography (also sometimes called 'gel filtration' or
    just 'gel chromatography' although it does not separate by a filtering
    mechanism, larger molecules passing more rapidly through the matrix than smaller
    molecules) is relatively slow and has the least capacity and resolution. It is
    generally left until last as an important final purification step and also as a
    method of changing the solution buffer before concentration, finishing and sale.
    Where sufficient information has been gathered regarding the size and variation
    of charge with pH of the required enzyme and its major contaminants, a rational
    purification scheme can be devised. A relatively quick analytical method for
    obtaining such data utilises a two-dimensional process whereby electrophoresis
    occurs in one direction and a range of pH is produced in the other; movement in
    the electric field determined by the size and sign of a protein's charge, which
    both depend on the pH. As the sample is applied across the range of pH, this
    method produces titration curves (i.e., charge versus pH) for all proteins
    present.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">A large effort has been applied to the development of chromatographic
matrices suitable for the separation of proteins. The main problem that has had
to be overcome is that of ensuring the matrix has sufficiently large surface
area available to molecules as large as proteins (i.e., they are macroporous)
while remaining rigid and incompressible under rapid elution conditions. In
addition, matrices must generally be hydrophilic and inert. Although the
standard bead diameters of most of these matrices are non-uniform and fairly
large (50 - 150 </font><font face="Symbol">m</font><font face="Arial">m), many are now supplied as uniform-sized small beads (e.g., 4 - 6
</font><font face="Symbol">m</font><font face="Arial">m diameter) which allows their use in very efficient
separation processes (high performance liquid chromatography,
<B>HPLC</B>), but at exponentially increasing cost with decreasing bead
size. Relatively high pressures are needed to operate such columns necessitating
specialised equipment and considerable additional expense. They are used only
for the small-scale production of expensive enzymes, where a high degree of
purity is required (e.g., restriction endonucleases and therapeutic enzymes).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Column manufacturers now supply equipment for monitoring and
controlling chromatography systems so that it is possible to have automated
apparatus which loads the sample, collects fractions and regenerates the column.
Such equipment must, of course, have fail-safe devices to protect both column
and product.</font></p>
