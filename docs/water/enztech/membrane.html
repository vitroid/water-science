<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The main requirement for a membrane reactor
  (MR) is a semipermeable membrane which allows the free passage of the product
  molecules but contains the enzyme molecules. A cheap example of such a membrane
  is the dialysis membrane used for removing low molecular weight species from
  protein preparations. The usual choice for a membrane reactor is a hollow-fibre
  reactor consisting of a preformed module containing hundreds of thin tubular
  fibres each having a diameter of about 200</font><font face="Symbol"> m</font><font face="Arial">m and a membrane thickness of about
    50&nbsp;</font><font face="Symbol"> m</font><font face="Arial">m. Membrane reactors may be used in either batch or continuous mode and
      allow the easy separation of the enzyme from the product. They are normally used
      with soluble enzymes, avoiding the costs and problems associated with other
      methods of immobilisation and some of the diffusion limitations of immobilised
      enzymes. If the substrate is able to diffuse through the membrane, it may be
      introduced to either side of the membrane with respect to the enzyme, otherwise
      it must be within the same compartment as the enzyme, a configuration that
      imposes a severe restriction on the flow rate through the reactor, if used in
      continuous mode. Due to the ease with which membrane reactor systems may be
      established, they are often used for production on a small scale (g to kg),
      especially where a multi-enzyme pathway or coenzyme regeneration is needed. They
      allow the easy replacement of the enzyme in processes involving particularly
      labile enzymes and can also be used for biphasic reactions (see <a href="biphasic2.html"> Chapter
        7</a>). The
      major disadvantage of these reactors concerns the cost of the membranes and
      their need to be replaced at regular intervals.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The kinetics of membrane reactors are similar
to those of the batch STR, in batch mode, or the CSTR, in continuous mode (see <a href="cstr.html">later</a>). Deviations from these models occur primarily in configurations where the
substrate stream is on the side of the membrane opposite to the enzyme and the
reaction is severely limited by its diffusion through the membrane and the
products' diffusion in the reverse direction. Under these circumstances the
reaction may be even more severely affected by product inhibition or the
limitations of reversibility than is indicated by these models.</font></p>
