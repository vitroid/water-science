<p align="left"><font face="arial"> Although the equilibrium position of reactions
  may be shifted in biphasic systems, this is of no practical consequence unless
  the reaction actually occurs. The enzyme must be able to convert the reactants
  to products. For this to proceed, even in the presence of fully active enzymes,
  there must be some reactant present in the aqueous microenvironment surrounding
  the enzyme. Reactants may have fairly low aqueous solubilities under the normal
  conditions associated with such biphasic processes. The aqueous phase remains
  effectively unstirred, even when the organic phase is well-stirred, during the
  reaction so that the thickness of the 'unstirred layer' (</font><font face="symbol">d</font><font face="arial">) is equal to
    the thickness of the aqueous layer surrounding the enzyme. Where </font><font face="symbol">d</font><font face="arial"> is
      large, the rate of reaction is likely to be controlled by the passage of
      reactants through this aqueous layer as the concentration gradients will be very
      shallow due to the low solubilities of the reactants in water. However,
  </font><font face="symbol">d</font><font face="arial"> is often very thin, however, especially where the enzyme is freely
    soluble, causing the reactions to be effectively diffusionally controlled by the
    passage of the reactants from the more concentrated organic phase through the
    interphase boundary to very low concentrations within the microenvironment of
    the enzyme. Clearly, the thickness of the aqueous layer around an immobilised
    enzyme will be of great importance in determining the degree of diffusional
    resistance involved, and hence the lowering of the reaction rate. As with all
    immobilised enzymes, the volumetric surface area (A/V) is an important parameter
    governing the overall flux of the substrate to the biocatalytic surface, the
    effectiveness of the enzyme and the productivity. Whereas in reactions involving
    a single liquid phase this surface area is the area presented by the exterior of
    the particles to the bulk of the liquid, in most practical biphasic liquid
    systems it is the interfacial area between the two liquid phases that is
    relevant. Under normal operating conditions this interfacial area will depend
    upon the volume of the aqueous droplet surrounding and enclosing the enzymic
    biocatalyst. As the relative volume of the organic phase increases the
    volumetric surface area will decrease, so reducing the maximum volumetric
    productivity. This will be of particular importance where </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial"> needs to be
      very high in order to shift the reaction equilibrium. Clearly this will reduce
      the reaction rate due to the reduction in the amount of enzyme that can be
      present, due to its associated water, and the associated reduction in the
      interfacial area. Where the catalysed reaction generates water, this should not
      generally be allowed to accumulate as it not only has a detrimental effect on
      the equilibrium constant but will also slow down the rate of reaction. </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial"> There are
some rules which allow the optimisation of the two-phase system for
enzyme-catalysed reactions. They depend upon the concept of Log<b><i>P</i></b>
being extended to cover the substrates, products and the interphase (see <a href="biphasic2.html#fig7_1"> Figure
7.1</a>). </font></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="arial"> The difference between the Log<b><i>P</i></b> values of the
substrate(s) and the interphase should be as small as possible whereas that of
the substrate(s) should be much lower than that of the organic phase. These
conditions encourage high concentrations of substrate(s) within the interphase
and, hence, the transfer of the substrate from the organic phase into the
aqueous phase.&nbsp; </font></li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><font face="arial"> The difference between the Log<b><i>P</i></b> values of the
product(s) and the organic phase should be as small as possible whereas that of
the product(s) should be much greater than that of the interphase. These
conditions encourage the transfer of the product from the aqueous phase through
the interphase into the organic phase, after reaction. </font></li>
</ol>

<p align="left"><font face="arial"> The Log<b><i>P</i></b>
of the interphase can be varied independently of the organic phase by suitable
choice of surfactants and cosurfactants. The precise structure of this
interphase may be much more complex than outlined in <a href="biphasic2.html#fig7_1"> Figure
7.1</a>. In particular,
when there is excess water and surfactant present, the surfactant may form
multiple concentric membranes, consisting of surfactant bilayers, around the
aqueous core. This presents another reason for the removal of the water produced
by use of hydrolases (used as synthetases) in biphasic systems. Control over the
amount of water surrounding the enzyme is often possible by means of molecular
sieves (e.g., potassium aluminium silicate), which absorb water. Removal of water
dissolved in the organic phase can easily be achieved by their use and this
leads to the depletion of water from the aqueous biocatalytic pools by its
partition. If the organic phase has a high boiling point the removal of water
may be simply achieved by vacuum distillation; e.g., in the esterification of
fatty acids and fatty alcohols catalysed by lipase and used in wax manufacture.&nbsp;</font></p>
