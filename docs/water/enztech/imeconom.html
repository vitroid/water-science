  <center><h1> <B><font face="Arial">The economic argument for immobilisation</font></B></h1></center>
  <p><font face="Arial">An important factor determining the use of enzymes in a
    technological process is their expense. Several hundred enzymes are commercially
    available at prices of about £1 mg<sup>&minus;1</sup>, although some are
    much cheaper and many are much more expensive. As enzymes are catalytic
    molecules, they are not directly used up by the processes in which they are
    used. Their high initial cost, therefore, should only be incidental to their
    use. However due to denaturation, they do lose activity with time. If possible,
    they should be stabilised against denaturation and utilised in an efficient
    manner. When they are used in a soluble form, they retain some activity after
    the reaction which cannot be economically recovered for re-use and is generally
    wasted. This activity residue remains to contaminate the product and its removal
    may involve extra purification costs. In order to eliminate this wastage, and
    give an improved productivity, simple and economic methods must be used which
    enable the separation of the enzyme from the reaction product. The easiest way
    of achieving this is by separating the enzyme and product during the reaction
    using a two-phase system; one phase containing the enzyme and the other phase
    containing the product. The enzyme is imprisoned within its phase allowing its
    re-use or continuous use but preventing it from contaminating the product; other
    molecules, including the reactants, are able to move freely between the two
    phases. This is known as <b>immobilisation</b> and may be achieved by
    fixing the enzyme to, or within, some other material. The term 'immobilisation'
    does not necessarily mean that the enzyme cannot move freely within its
    particular phase, although this is often the case. A wide variety of insoluble
    materials, also known as substrates (not to be confused with the enzymes'
    reactants), may be used to immobilise the enzymes by making them insoluble.
    These are usually inert polymeric or inorganic matrices.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Immobilisation of
enzymes often incurs an additional expense and is only undertaken if there is a
sound economic or process advantage in the use of the immobilised, rather than
free (soluble), enzymes. The most important benefit derived from immobilisation
is the easy separation of the enzyme from the products of the catalysed
reaction. This prevents the enzyme contaminating the product, minimising
downstream processing costs and possible effluent handling problems,
particularly if the enzyme is noticeably toxic or antigenic. It also allows
continuous processes to be practicable, with a considerable saving in enzyme,
labour and overhead costs. Immobilisation often affects the stability and
activity of the enzyme, but conditions are usually available where these
properties are little changed or even enhanced. The productivity of an enzyme,
so immobilised, is greatly increased as it may be more fully used at higher
substrate concentrations for longer periods than the free enzyme. Insoluble
immobilised enzymes are of little use, however, where any of the reactants are
also insoluble, due to steric difficulties.</font></p>
