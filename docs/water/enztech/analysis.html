  <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Enzymes make excellent analytical reagents due to their
    specificity, selectivity and efficiency. They are often used to determine the
    concentration of their substrates (as analytes) by means of the resultant
    initial reaction rates. If the reaction conditions and enzyme concentrations are
    kept constant, these rates of reaction (v) are proportional to the substrate
    concentrations ([S]) at low substrate concentrations. When [S] &lt; 0.1 K<sub>m</sub>,
  <a href="kinetics.html#eq1_8"> equation 1.8</a> simplifies to give </font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial">v =
(V<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>)[S]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(6.1) </font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial">The rates of reaction are
commonly determined from the difference in optical absorbance between the
reactants and products. An example of this is the </font><font face="symbol">b</font><font face="arial">-D-galactose
dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.48) assay for galactose which involves the oxidation of
galactose by the redox coenzyme, nicotine-adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="symbol">b</font><font face="arial">-D-galactose +
NAD<sup>+</sup> </font><font face="symbol"><img border="0" src="images/farrow.gif" alt="forward arrow" width="47" height="13"></font><font face="arial">
D-galactono-1,4-lactone + NADH + H<sup>+</sup><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[6.1]</b></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">A
0.1 mM solution of NADH has an absorbance at 340nm, in a 1 cm path-length
cuvette, of 0.622, whereas the NAD<sup>+</sup> from which it is derived has
effectively zero absorbance at this wavelength. The conversion (NAD<sup>+</sup> </font><font face="symbol"><img border="0" src="images/farrow.gif" alt="forward arrow" width="47" height="13"></font><font face="arial">
NADH) is, therefore, accompanied by a large increase in
absorption of light at this wavelength. For the reaction to be linear with
respect to the galactose concentration, the galactose is kept within a
concentration range well below the K<sub>m</sub> of the enzyme for galactose. In
contrast, the NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration is kept within a concentration range
well above the K<sub>m</sub> of the enzyme for NAD<sup>+</sup>, in order to avoid
limiting the reaction rate. Such assays are commonly used in analytical
laboratories and are, indeed, excellent where a wide variety of analyses need to
be undertaken on a relatively small number of samples. The drawbacks to this
type of analysis become apparent when a large number of repetitive assays need
to be performed. Then, they are seen to be costly in terms of expensive enzyme
and coenzyme usage, time consuming, labour intensive and in need of skilled and
reproducible operation within properly equipped analytical laboratories. For
routine or on-site operation, these disadvantages must be overcome. This is
being achieved by the production of biosensors which exploit biological systems
in association with advances in micro-electronic technology.</font></p>
