</center><h1 align="center"> <font face="Arial">Whither enzyme technology?</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial">There are many directions in which enzyme technologists are currently
  applying their art and which are at the forefront of biotechnological research
  and development. Some of these have already been examined in some detail earlier
  (see Chapters <a href="biosensors.html"> 6</a> and <a href="biphasic2.html">7</a>). At present, relatively few enzymes are available on a
  large scale (i.e., &gt; kg) and are suitable for industrial applications. These
  shortcomings are being addressed in a number of ways:</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">new enzymes are being
sought in the natural environment and by strain selection (see <a href="sources.html"> Chapter
    2</a>);</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">established industrial enzymes are being used in as wide a variety
    of ways as can
be conceived;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">novel enzymes are being designed and produce by genetic
engineering;</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">new organic catalysts are being designed and synthesised using
the 'knowhow' established from enzymology; and</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">more complex enzyme systems
are being utilised.</font></li>
</ol>
<p><font face="Arial">Each of these areas has a extensive and rapidly expanding
literature. Some advances possibly belong more properly to other areas of
science. Thus, the development of genetically improved enzymes is generally
undertaken by molecular biologists and the design and synthesis of novel
enzyme-like catalysts is in the provenance of the organic chemists. Both groups
of workers will, however, base their science on data provided by the enzyme
technologist. Space requirements in this volume do not allow the full treatment
of these related areas but will be discussed briefly here.</font></p>
