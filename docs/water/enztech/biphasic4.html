  <p align="left"><font face="arial"> Aqueous 2-phase systems (see <a href="biphasic1.html">
    Chapter 2</a>) offer the opportunity to shift reaction equilibria towards product
    formation by ensuring that enzyme and substrate partition into one phase while
    the product enters, and may be removed from, the other. The theory developed
    (earlier) for aqueous/organic biphasic systems is equally applicable to these
    systems. An example of such an extractive bioconversion is a method for the
    conversion of starch to glucose using bacterial </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylase and
      glucoamylase. Starch substrate partitions almost entirely into the lower, more
      hydrophilic, dextran-rich phase of a system comprising 3% polyethylene glycol
      (PEG 20,000) and 5% crude unfractionated dextran. The enzymes also partition
      largely to the bottom phase but the glucose, produced by the hydrolysis,
      distributes itself more evenly between the phases. A small proportion of the
      glucoamylase enters the upper phase and will convert any oligosaccharide
      entering that phase to glucose. Concentrations of up to 140 g L<sup>&minus;1</sup>
      glucose may be reached in the upper phase.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="arial">Such a system offers some of the
advantages of an immobilised enzyme process without some of the disadvantages.
The enzymes are largely retained and are stabilised by the presence of the
polymers yet catalysis is in homogeneous solution (within the phase) so no
diffusion limitations to mass transfer exist. Drawbacks include the need to
separate the product from the upper phase polymers and gradual loss of enzymes
which enter the upper phase. Enzyme loss could be reduced, without introducing
diffusion limitations, by linking them to hydrophilic polymers so as to form
soluble complexes.</font></p>
