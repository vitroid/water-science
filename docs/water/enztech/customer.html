<b><font face="Arial" color="#006666" size="+3">Enzyme Technology</font></b>

</center>
  <center><h1> <B><font face="Arial">Customer service</font></B></h1></center>
  <p><font face="Arial">A customer who is likely to use large quantities of an enzyme
    will be expected to specify the form and activity in which the enzyme is
    supplied. The development of a new enzyme-catalysed process is often a matter of
    teamwork between the customer and the enzyme company's development scientists.
    Once the process is running, the enzyme company will probably be in contact with
    the customer through three types of individuals:</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Arial">Salespeople who ensure
that the supply of enzyme continues and that the cost of the enzyme is mutually
    acceptable.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">Technical salespeople who liase with technical managers to
ensure that their product is performing up to specification. This association
often leads to suggestions for the improvement of the process. The technical
sales team will be expected by the customer to deal with problems to do with the
enzyme. They may be able to solve problems themselves or may require the
services of the third group, the laboratory or pilot plant scientists.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Arial">The laboratory and pilot plant scientists will spend some time
trouble-shooting as and when necessary. They may test materials for customers,
for instance if a new source of raw material is under consideration.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Arial">All the
enzyme company's employees must, of course, work as a team and it is in the
interests of both customer and manufacturer if their technical experts also
cooperate closely. Both organisations will learn from each other. Technical
advances should accrue as a result of suggestions from both sides.</font></p>
