<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Invertase was probably the first enzyme to be
  used on a large scale in an immobilised form (by Tate &amp; Lyle). In the period
  1941 -1946 the acid, previously used in the manufacture of Golden Syrup, was
  unavailable, so yeast invertase was used instead. Yeast cells were autolysed and
  the autolysate clarified by adjustment to pH 4.7, followed by filtration through
  a bed of calcium sulphate and adsorption into bone char. A layer of the bone
  char containing invertase was included in the bed of bone char already used for
  decolourising the syrup. The scale used was large, the bed of invertase-char
  being 2 ft (60 cm) deep in a bed of char 20 ft (610 cm) deep. The preparation
  was very stable, the limiting factors being microbial contamination or loss of
  decolourising power rather than loss of enzymic activity. The process was cost-effective but, not surprisingly, the product did not have the subtlety of
  flavour of the acid-hydrolysed material and the immobilised enzyme process was
  abandoned when the acid became available once again. Recently, however, it has
  been relaunched using Brimac<sup>TM</sup>, where the invertase -char mix is stabilised by
  cross-linking and has a half-life of 90 days in use (pH 5.5, 50°C). The
  revival is due, in part, to the success of HFCS as a high-quality low-colour
  sweetener. It is impossible to produce inverted syrups of equivalent quality by
  acid hydrolysis. Enzymic inversion avoids the high-colour, high salt-ash,
  relatively low conversion and batch variability problems of acid hydrolysis.
  Although free invertase may be used (with residence times of about a day), the
  use of immobilised enzymes in a PBR (with residence time of about 15 min) makes
  the process competitive; the cost of 95% inversion (at 50% (w/w)) being no more
  than the final evaporation costs (to 75% (w/w)). A productivity of 16 tonnes of
  inverted syrup (dry weight) may be achieved using one litre of the granular
  enzyme.</font></p>
