<p> <font face="Arial"> It is important to have as thorough
  knowledge as is possible of the performance characteristics of enzymes, if they
  are to be used most efficiently. The kinetic parameters V<sub>max</sub>,
  K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> should, therefore, be determined.
  There are two approaches to this problem using either the reaction progress
  curve (integral method) or the initial rates of reaction (differential method).
  Use of either method depends on prior knowledge of the mechanism for the
  reaction and, at least approximately, the optimum conditions for the reaction.
  If the mechanism is known and complex then the data must be reconciled to the
  appropriate model (hypothesis), usually by use of a computer-aided analysis
  involving a weighted least-squares fit. Many such computer programs are
  currently available and, if not, the programming skill involved is usually
  fairly low. If the mechanism is not known, initial attempts are usually made to
  fit the data to the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model. Combining equations (<a href="kinetics.html#1_1">1.1</a>) and
  (<a href="kinetics.html#eq1_8">1.8</a>),</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial">&nbsp;Use of equation (<a href="determination.html#1_99">1.99</a>)
involves the determination of the initial rate of reaction over a wide range of
substrate concentrations. The initial rates are used, so that [S] =
[S]<sub>0</sub>, the predetermined and accurately known substrate concentration
at the start of the reaction. Its use also ensures that there is no effect of
reaction reversibility or product inhibition which may affect the integral
method based on equation (<a href="determination.html#1_102">1.102</a>). Equation (<a href="determination.html#1_99">1.99</a>) can be utilised directly using a
computer program, involving a weighted least-squares fit, where the parameters
for determining the hyperbolic relationship between the initial rate of reaction
and initial substrate concentration (i.e., K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub>) are
chosen in order to minimise the errors between the data and the model, and the
assumption is made that the errors inherent in the practically determined data
are normally distributed about their mean (error-free) value.</font></p>

<p> <font face="Arial"> Alternatively the direct linear plot may be used (<a href="determination.html#fig1_10">Figure
1.10</a>). This is a powerful non-parametric statistical method which
depends upon the assumption that any errors in the experimentally derived data
are as likely to be positive (i.e., too high) as negative (i.e., too low). It is
common practice to show the data obtained by the above statistical methods on
one of three linearised plots, derived from equation (<a href="determination.html#1_99">1.99</a>) (<a href="determination.html#fig1_11">Figure
1.11</a>). Of
these, the double reciprocal plot is preferred to test for the qualitative
correctness of a proposed mechanism, and the Eadie-Hofstee plot is preferred for
discovering deviations from linearity.</font></p>

              direct linear plot. A plot of the initial rate of reaction against 
              the initial substrate concentration also showing the way estimates 
              can be directly made of the K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub>. Every 
              pair of data points may be utilised to give a separate estimate 
              of these parameters (i.e., n(n-1)/2 estimates from n data points 
              with differing [S]<sub>0</sub>). These estimates are determined 
              from the intersections of lines passing through the (x,y) points 
              (-[S]<sub>0</sub>,0) and (0,v); each intersection forming a separate 
              estimate of K<sub>m</sub> and V<sub>max</sub>. The intersections 
              are separately ranked in order of increasing value of both K<sub>m</sub> 
              and V<sub>max</sub> and the median values taken as the best estimates 
              for these parameters. The error in these estimates can be simply 
              determined from sub-ranges of these estimates, the width of the 
              sub-range dependent on the accuracy required for the error and the 
              number of data points in the analysis. In this example there are 
              7 data points and, therefore, 21 estimates for both K<sub>m</sub> 
              and V<sub>max</sub>. The ranked list of the estimates for K<sub>m</sub> 
              (mM) is 0.98,1.65, 1.68, 1.70, 1.85, 1.87, 1.89, 1.91, 1.94, 1.96,

              2.81, with a median value of 1.98 mM. The K<sub>m</sub> must lie 
              between the 4th (1.70 mM) and 18th (2.25 mM) estimate at a confidence 
              level of 97% (Cornish-Bowden <I>et al.</I>, 1978). The list of the 
              estimates for V<sub>max</sub> (<font face="Symbol">m</font>M.min<sup>&minus;1</sup>) 
              is ranked separately as 3.45, 3.59, 3.80, 3.85, 3.87, 3.89, 3.91, 
              3.94, 3.96, 3.96, <b>3.98</b>, 4.01, 4.03, 4.05, 4.13, 4.14, 4.18, 
              4.26, 4.29, 4.35, with a median value of 3.98 <font face="Symbol">m</font>M.min<sup>&minus;1</sup>. 
              The V<sub>max</sub> must lie between the 4th (3.85 <font face="Symbol">m</font>M.min<sup>&minus;1</sup>) 
              and 18th (4.18 <font face="Symbol">m</font>M.min<sup>&minus;1</sup>) estimate 
              at a confidence level of 97%. It can be seen that outlying estimates 
              have little or no influence on the results. This is a major advantage 
              over the least-squared statistical procedures where rogue data points 
              cause heavily biased effects.</font></p>

The progress curve of the reaction (<a href="determination.html#fig1_12">Figure 1.12</a>) can be
used to determine the specificity constant (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>) by
making use of the relationship between time of reaction and fractional
conversion (see equation (<a href="determination.html#1_102">1.102</a>). This has the advantage over the use of the
initial rates (above) in that fewer determinations need to be made, possibly
only one progress curve is necessary, and sometimes the initial rate of reaction
is rather difficult to determine due to its rapid decline. If only the early
part of the progress curve, or its derivative, is utilised in the analysis, this
procedure may even be used in cases where there is competitive inhibition by the
product, or where the reaction is reversible.</font></p>
