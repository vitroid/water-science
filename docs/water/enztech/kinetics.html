It is
established that enzymes form a bound complex to their reactants (i.e., <B>substrates</B>) during the course of their catalysis and prior to
the release of products. This can be simply illustrated, using the mechanism
based on that of Michaelis and Menten for a one-substrate reaction, by the
reaction sequence:</font></p>

  </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">where <i> k</i><sub>+1</sub>, <i> k</i><sub>-1</sub> and 
  <i> k</i><sub>+2</sub> are the respective rate constants, typically having values 
  of 10<sup>5</sup> - 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>&minus;1</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup>, 1 - 10<sup>4</sup> 
  s<sup>&minus;1</sup> and 1 - 10<sup>5</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup> respectively; the sign 
  of the subscripts indicating the direction in which the rate constant is acting. 
  For the sake of simplicity the reverse reaction concerning the conversion of 
  product to substrate is not included in this scheme. This is allowable (1) at 
  the beginning of the reaction when there is no, or little, product present, 
  or (2) when the reaction is effectively irreversible. Reversible reactions are 
  dealt with in more detail later in this chapter. The rate of reaction (v) is 
  the rate at which the product is formed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The
differential equation 1.5 is difficult to handle, but may be greatly simplified
if it can be assumed that the left hand side is equal to [ES] alone. This
assumption is valid under the sufficient but unnecessarily restrictive steady
state approximation that the rate of formation of ES equals its rate of
disappearance by product formation and reversion to substrate (i.e., d[ES]/dt is
zero). It is additionally valid when the condition:</font></p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/kineti9.gif" align="middle" alt="((d[ES]/dt )/(k+1[S] + k-1 + k+2)) << [ES] " width="172" height="64">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial">(1.6)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">is valid. This occurs during a substantial part of the
reaction time-course over a wide range of kinetic rate constants and substrate
concentrations and at low to moderate enzyme concentrations. The variation in
[ES], d[ES]/dt, [S] and [P] with the time-course of the reaction is shown in
Figure 1.2, where it may be seen that the simplified equation is valid
throughout most of the reaction.</font></p>

[ES] stays constant but only a small proportion of the substrate reacts. This is
followed by the final phase, taking about 6 hours during which the substrate is
completely converted to product.&nbsp;<br>

<p><font face="Arial">where

[E]<sub>0</sub> when [E]<sub>0</sub> is less than [S]<sub>0</sub>). Equation 1.8
may be rearranged to show the dependence of the rate of reaction on the ratio of
[S] to <i> K<sub>m</sub></i>,</font></p>

use these equations to relate the initial rate of reaction to the initial, and
easily predetermined, substrate concentration (Figure 1.3). This also avoids any
problem that may occur through product inhibition or reaction reversibility (see
later).</font></p>

<p><b>Figure 1.3.</b> A normalised plot of the initial rate (v<sub>0</sub>)
against initial substrate concentration ([S]<sub>0</sub>) for a reaction obeying
the Michaelis-Menten kinetics (equation 1.8). The plot has been normalised in
order to make it more generally applicable by plotting the relative initial rate
of reaction (v<sub>0</sub>/<i>V</i><sub><i>max</i></sub>) against the initial substrate
concentration relative to the Michaelis constant ([S]<sub>0</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub></i>,
more commonly referred to as <font face="symbol">b</font>, the dimensionless substrate
concentration). The curve is a rectangular hyperbola with asymptotes at
v<sub>0</sub> = <i> V</i><sub><i>max</i></sub> and [S]<sub>0</sub> = -<i>K<sub>m</sub></i>. The tangent to
the curve at the origin goes through the point (v<sub>0</sub> = <i>
V</i><sub><i>max</i></sub>),([S]<sub>0</sub> = <i> K<sub>m</sub></i>). The ratio
<i>
V</i><sub><i>max</i></sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub> </i> is an important kinetic parameter which describes
the relative specificity of a fixed amount of the enzyme for its substrate (more
precisely defined in terms of <i> k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub></i>). The substrate
concentration, which gives a rate of half the maximum reaction velocity, is
equal to the <i> K<sub>m</sub></i>.</p>

<hr>
<p><font face="Arial">It has been established that
few enzymes follow the Michaelis-Menten equation over a wide range of
experimental conditions. However, it remains by far the most generally
applicable equation for describing enzymic reactions. Indeed it can be
realistically applied to a number of reactions which have a far more complex
mechanism than the one described here. In these cases <i> K<sub>m</sub> </i> remains an
important quantity, characteristic of the enzyme and substrate, corresponding to
the substrate concentration needed for half the enzyme molecules to bind to the
substrate (and, therefore, causing the reaction to proceed at half its maximum
rate) but the precise kinetic meaning derived earlier may not hold and may be
misleading. In these cases the K<sub>m</sub> is likely to equal a much more
complex relationship between the many rate constants involved in the reaction
scheme. It remains independent of the enzyme and substrate concentrations and
indicates the extent of binding between the enzyme and its substrate for a given
substrate concentration, a lower K<sub>m</sub> indicating a greater extent of
binding. <i> V</i><sub><i>max</i></sub> clearly depends on the enzyme concentration and for
some, but not all, enzymes may be largely independent of the specific substrate
used. <i> K<sub>m</sub> </i> and <i> V</i><sub><i>max</i></sub> may both be influenced by the charge and
conformation of the protein and substrate(s) which are determined by pH,
temperature, ionic strength and other factors. It is often preferable to
substitute <B><i>k</i><sub>cat</sub></B> for <i> k</i><sub>+2</sub>, where <i>
V<sub>max</sub>  </i> = <i> k</i><sub>cat</sub>[E]<sub>0</sub>, as the precise meaning of
<i>
k</i><sub>+2</sub>, above, may also be misleading. <i> k</i><sub>cat</sub> is also known as
the <B>turnover number</B> as it represents the maximum number of
substrate molecules that the enzyme can 'turn over' to product in a set time (e.g., the turnover numbers of </font><font face="symbol">a</font><font face="arial">-amylase, glucoamylase and glucose isomerase
are 500 s<sup>&minus;1</sup>, 160 s<sup>&minus;1</sup> and 3 s<sup>&minus;1</sup> respectively; an
enzyme with a relative molecular mass of 60000 and specific activity 1 U
mg<sup>&minus;1</sup> has a turnover number of 1 s<sup>&minus;1</sup>). The ratio <i>
k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub> </i> determines the relative rate of reaction at low
substrate concentrations, and is known as the <B>specificity
constant</B>. It is also the apparent 2<sup>nd</sup> order rate constant at
low substrate concentrations (see Figure 1.3), where</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="images/kineti13.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="v = (kcat/Km)[E]0[S]" width="106" height="46">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(1.11)</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Many applications
of enzymes involve open systems, where the substrate concentration remains
constant, due to replenishment, throughout the reaction time-course. This is, of
course, the situation that often prevails <I>in vivo</I>. Under these
circumstances, the Michaelis-Menten equation is obeyed over an even wider range
of enzyme concentrations than allowed in closed systems, and is commonly used to
model immobilised enzyme kinetic systems (see Chapter 3).</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">Enzymes have evolved by
maximising <i> k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub>  </i>  (i.e., the specificity constant for the
substrate) while keeping <i> K<sub>m</sub> </i> approximately identical to the naturally
encountered substrate concentration. This allows the enzyme to operate
efficiently and yet exercise some control over the rate of reaction.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">The
specificity constant is limited by the rate at which the reactants encounter one
another under the influence of diffusion. For a single-substrate reaction the
rate of encounter between the substrate and enzyme is about 10<sup>8</sup> -
10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>&minus;1</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup>. The specificity constant of some
enzymes approach this value although the range of determined values is very
broad (e.g., <i> k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub> </i> for catalase is 4 x 10<sup>7</sup>
M<sup>&minus;1</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup>, whereas it is 25 M<sup>&minus;1</sup> s<sup>&minus;1</sup> for
glucose isomerase, and for other enzymes varies from less than 1 M<sup>&minus;1</sup>
s<sup>&minus;1</sup> to greater than 10<sup>8</sup> M<sup>&minus;1</sup>
s<sup>&minus;1</sup>).</font></p>
