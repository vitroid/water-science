<p align="left"><font face="Arial">An enzyme reactor consists of a vessel, or
  series of vessels, used to perform a desired conversion by enzymic means. A
  number of important types of such reactor are shown diagrammatically in <a href="#fig5_1"> Figure
    5.1</a>. There are several important factors that determine the choice of reactor
  for a particular process. In general, the choice depends on the cost of a
  predetermined productivity within the product's specifications. This must be
  inclusive of the costs associated with substrate(s), downstream processing,
  labour, depreciation, overheads and process development, in addition to the more
  obvious costs concerned with building and running the enzyme reactor. Other
  contributing factors are the form of the enzyme of choice (i.e., free or
  immobilised), the kinetics of the reaction and the chemical and physical
  properties of an immobilisation support including whether it is particulate,
  membranous or fibrous, and its density, compressibility, robustness, particle
  size and regenerability. Attention must also be paid to the scale of operation,
  the possible need for pH and temperature control, the supply and removal of
  gases and the stability of the enzyme, substrate and product. These factors will
  be discussed in more detail with respect to the different types of reactor.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial">Batch reactors generally consist of a tank
containing a stirrer (stirred tank reactor, STR). The tank is normally fitted
with fixed baffles that improve the stirring efficiency. A batch reactor is one
in which all of the product is removed, as rapidly as is practically possible,
after a fixed time. Generally this means that the enzyme and substrate molecules
have identical residence times within the reactor, although in some
circumstances there may be a need for further additions of enzyme and/or
substrate (i.e., fed -batch operation). The operating costs of batch reactors are
higher than for continuous processes due to the necessity for the reactors to be
emptied and refilled both regularly and often. This procedure is not only
expensive in itself but means that there are considerable periods when such
reactors are not productive; it also makes uneven demands on both labour and
services. STRs can be used for processes involving non-immobilised enzymes, if
the consequences of these contaminating the product are not severe. Batch
reactors also suffer from pronounced batch-to-batch variations, as the
reaction conditions change with time, and may be difficult to scale-up, due to
the changing power requirements for efficient fixing. They do, however, have a
number of advantageous features. Primary amongst these is their simplicity both
in use and in process development. For this reason they are preferred for small-scale production of highly priced products, especially where the same equipment
is to be used for a number of different conversions. They offer a closely
controllable environment that is useful for slow reactions, where the
composition may be accurately monitored, and conditions (e.g., temperature, pH,
coenzyme concentrations) varied throughout the reaction. They are also of use
when continuous operation of a process proves to be difficult due to the viscous
or intractable nature of the reaction mix.</font></p>

decrease (reactor (f)) the stirring efficiency. The continuous reactors ((c)
-(f)) may all be used in a recycle mode where some, or most, of the product
stream is mixed with the incoming substrate stream. All reactors may use
immobilised enzymes. In addition, reactors (a), (b) and (e) (plus reactors (d)

reactor length and I is the reactor length) is relative to the length (i.e., when I°

flow rate if the enzyme acted at its maximum velocity throughout; the actual
reactor length necessary for complete conversion being longer due to the
reduction in the substrate concentration as the reaction progresses. P may be
considered as the relative position within a PBR or the reactor's absolute
length.</font></p>
