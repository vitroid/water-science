  <center><h1>Glucose from cellulose</h1></center>
  <p><font face="Arial">There is very much more cellulose available, as a
    potential source of glucose, than starch, yet cellulose is not a significant
    source of pure glucose. The reasons for this are many, some technical, some
    commercial. The fundamental reason is that starch is produced in relatively pure
    forms by plants for use as an easily biodegradable energy and carbon store.
    Cellulose is structural and is purposefully combined and associated with lignin
    and pentosans, so as to resist biodegradation; dead trees take several years to
    decay even in tropical rainforests. A typical waste cellulolytic material
    contains less than half cellulose, most of the remainder consisting of roughly
    equal quantities of lignin and pentosans. A combination of enzymes is needed to
    degrade this mixture. These enzymes are comparatively unstable of low activity
    against native lignocellulose and subject to both substrate and product
    inhibition. Consequently, although many cellulolytic enzymes exist and it is
    possible to convert pure cellulose to glucose using only enzymes, the cost of
    this conversion is excessive. The enzymes might be improved by strain selection
    from the wild or by mutation but problems caused by the physical nature of
    cellulose are not so amenable to solution. Granular starch is readily stirred in
    slurries containing 40% (w/v) solids and is easily solubilised but, even when
    pure, fibrous cellulose forms immovable cakes at 10% solids and remains
    insoluble in all but the most exotic (and enzyme denaturing) solvents. Impure
    cellulose often contains almost an equal mass of lignin, which is of little or no
    value as a by-product and is difficult an expensive to remove.</font></p>

<hr>
<p><font face="Arial">Proper economic analysis reveals that cheap sources of
cellulose prove to be generally more expensive as sources of glucose than
apparently more expensive starch. Relatively pure cellulose is valuable in its
own right, as a paper pulp and chipboard raw material, which currently commands
a price of over twice that of corn starch. With the increasing world shortage of
pulp it cannot be seen realistically as an alternative source of glucose in the
foreseeable future. Knowledge of enzyme systems capable of degrading
lignocellulose is advancing rapidly but it is unlikely that lignocellulose will
replace starch as a source of glucose syrups for food use. It is, however, quite
possible that it may be used, in a process involving the simultaneous use of
both enzymes and fermentative yeasts, to produce ethanol; the utilisation of the
glucose by the yeast removing its inhibitory effect on the enzymes. It should be
noted that cellobiose is a non-fermentable sugar and must be hydrolysed by

process efficiency (<a href="#fig4_4">Figure 4.4</a>).</font></p>
