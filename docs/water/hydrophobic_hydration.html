    <h2><a name="hyd" id="hyd"></a>The hydrophobic effect</h2>
    <p align="left">The term 'hydrophobic' is derived from <em>hydro-</em> (water) and <em>phobos</em> (fear). However, it is not so much that hydrophobic molecules 'fear' (that is, 'does not enjoy the company of') water as water 'fears' the hydrophobic molecules. Hydrophobic molecules in water generally tend to aggregate,  minimizing their surface contact and associated surface energy with water; hence 'oils and water do not mix'. Smaller hydrophobic materials do, however, dissolve to a small extent in water as water molecules can arrange around them without breaking hydrogen bonds or losing much energy and the hydrophobic molecule can interact with these water molecules with multiple <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> interactions, due to the small size of water molecules and flexibility in their spatial arrangement. The following thermodynamic effects are found on hydrophobic hydration [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref14.html#r1376">1376</a><a name="r1376" id="r1376"></a>]:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An increase in the chemical potential of the solute, indicative of its  low solubility.</li>
      <li>A strong temperature dependence in the enthalpy of the system from exothermic at low temperatures (where the hydrophobic solute can fit into the pre-existing low-density water network and gain multiple van der Waals interactions, that may be correlated and show synergism [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref14.html#r1376">1376</a>]) to endothermic at high temperatures (where  the cavity formation required for the hydrophobic solute absorbs energy).</li>
      <li>A significant negative entropy of mixing compared with the formation of a hypothetical ideal solution.</li>
      <li>A decrease in the partial molar volume (it is lower by 5&ndash;20 cm<sup>3</sup>   &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> in a dilute aqueous solution than in a nonpolar organic solvent), as the molecule fits into cavities in the water network.</li>
      <li>An increase in heat capacity (see below) </li>
      <li>Cosolvents such as <a href="aqueous_alcohol.html">alcohols</a>, and <a href="kosmotropes_chaotropes.html#non">non-ionic kosmotropes</a>, modulate hydrophobic effects  and stabilize collapsed hydrophobic structures [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3207">3207</a><a name="r3207" id="r3207"></a>].</li>
</ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The &quot;hydrophobic effect&quot; of hydrophobic solutes 
      in water (such as <a title="go to find more information"  href="material_anomalies.html#min">nonpolar gases</a>) 
      is primarily a consequence of changes in the clustering in 
      the surrounding water and the consequential difference in energy between these water molecules and the bulk water, rather than water-solute interactions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1674" name="r1674" id="r1674">1674</a>]. 
      It has been quantified using a 1-propanol cosolvent probing methodology  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2211">2211</a><a name="r2211" id="r2211"></a>]. Hydrophobic hydration (for reviews, see [<a  href="ref3.html#r241" name="r241" title="go to cited reference" id="r241">241</a>, <a  href="ref24.html#r2363" name="r2363" title="go to cited reference" id="r2363">2363</a>]) 
      produces a reduction in density and an increase in  heat 
      capacity [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r821">821</a><a name="r821" id="r821"></a>]. 
      The expanded network causes the density decrease, whereas the 
      ordered bonds must be bent on increasing the temperature, 
      so affecting the heat capacity. Thus, hydrophobic hydration 
      behaves oppositely  to polar hydration, as polar hydration increases 
      the density and decreases heat capacity due to their associated 
      disorganized hydrogen bonds being already bent or broken. 
      Hydrophobic hydration is accompanied by </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">(a) a negative enthalpy 
      change, due in part to the multiple <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> interactions between water and the hydrophobic material,      </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">(b) a negative entropy change due to the increased order in the 
      surrounding water and the loss of translational entropy caused by the insertion of the cavity into the  hydrogen-bonding network,</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">(c) a positive heat capacity change (C<sub>P</sub>) 
      due to the negative enthalpy change (i.e., the stronger 
      hydrogen bonds at the surface), and </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> (d)  an overall reduction 
      in volume due to the more efficient solute packing density, only 
      partially compensated by the localized solvent density decrease 
    [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r903">903</a><a name="r903" id="r903"></a>].</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">For example, adding CH<sub>2</sub> groups to aliphatic alcohols increases the heat produced on solution (&Delta;H/CH<sub>2</sub> = -5.4 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>) but causes a more significant decrease in the entropy (-T&Delta;S/CH<sub>2</sub> = +7.1 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1217">1217</a><a name="r1217" id="r1217"></a>]. The increased van der Waals attractions over the liquid-gas interface cause <abbr title="surface tension at the liquid-solid interface">&gamma;<sub>LS</sub></abbr> &lt; <abbr title="surface tension at the liquid-gas interface">&gamma;<sub>LG</sub></abbr>. These  thermodynamic factors compensate to some extent, but the entropy term is most  significant, so the free energy is generally positive, accounting for the low  solubility of hydrophobic molecules in water. Many clathrate-like cages have  been proposed for the first hydration shell of alkanes [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4373">4373</a><a name="r4373" id="r"></a>]. These adapt to  the shape and conformation of the alkane and maximize the number of hydrogen  bonds and alkane-water van der Waals interactions while minimizing the cage  volumes.    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">A water layer with a thickness of up to 35 nm exists at hydrophobic surfaces. This layer is characterized by a more ordered network of hydrogen bonds than liquid water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1714">1714</a><a name="r1714" id="r1714"></a>], with stronger hydrogen bonding evident at lower temperatures but lost at higher temperatures [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1944">1944</a><a name="r1944" id="r1944"></a>].<sup><a href="#h" name="bh" id="bh"> h</a></sup> There are at least six (equivalent) ways of 
      describing what happens to the structure of water at hydrophobic 
      surfaces (see also <a title="go to 'Evidence for water clusters' page"  href="cluster_evidence.html#vic">vicinal water</a>) </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
      <li> Water at a hydrophobic surface loses a hydrogen bond and  has increased enthalpy. Water molecules compensate 
        for this by doing pressure-volume work; that is, the 
        network expands to form low-density water with lower entropy 
        (for example, see [<a  href="ref4.html#r318" name="r318" title="go to cited reference" id="r318">318</a>]). Replacement of this water and binding of other ligands to this hydrophobic surface  primarily depends on the differences in the free energy of this water  and water in the bulk. Such free energies depend strongly on the  surface topography.</li>
      <li> Water covers the surface with clathrate-like pentagons 
        in partial dodecahedra,  avoiding the loss of most of 
        the hydrogen bonds  [<a  href="ref26.html#r2512" name="r2512" title="go to cited reference" id="r2512">2512</a>, <a  href="ref29.html#r2850" name="r2850" title="go to cited reference" id="r2850">2850</a>]. Such pentagons have been found using molecular dynamics using a polarizable force field [<a  href="ref22.html#r2140" name="r2140" title="go to cited reference" id="r2140">2140</a>] and clathrate-like structures found experimentally by infrared spectroscopy [<a  href="ref30.html#r2950" title="go to cited reference">2950</a>]. This necessitates an expanded low-density 
        local structure; an 'iceberg model'    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3235">3235</a><a name="r3235" id="r3235"></a>], where the localized water molecules are bound more strongly between themselves rather than to bulk water molecules. Note that the formation of clathrate structures 
        maximizes the van der Waals contacts between the hydrophobic 
        solute and the water but without reducing the hydrogen bonding. 
        The rotational restriction of the hydrogen bonds at the 
        hydrophobic surface may be partially responsible for their 
        increased strength. Such clathrate structures do not exist 
        as rigid 'crystal-like' clusters but are minimum enthalpy 
        structures and are easily and continually disrupted by kinetic 
        effects (for example, raised temperature). It has been found  that at any instant,<sup> <a href="#a" name="ba" id="ba">a</a></sup> some of these water molecules are much more rotationally fixed (immobilized) than the others, with the proportion 'fixed' dependent on the structure covered [<a  href="ref14.html#r1330" name="r1330" title="go to cited reference" id="r1330">1330</a>].<sup><a href="#g" name="bg" id="bg">a</a></sup> Also, some of these water molecules remain present for extended periods  within the hydration shell [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1894">1894</a><a name="r1894" id="r1894"></a>].</li>
      <li> Water's chemical potential is raised due to the dangling 
        bonds. Water decreases this potential by expanding the water 
        network. This expansion has been verified at the hydrophobic 
        air-water interface at about 6% using extended X-ray absorption 
        fine structure (EXAFS) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r415">415</a><a name="r415" id="r415"></a>], 
        about 6-12% over 2-5 nm by neutron reflectivity [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r487">487</a><a name="r487" id="r487"></a>] 
        and about 7-10% over 1-1.5 nm by X-ray reflectivity [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r486">486</a><a name="r486" id="r486"></a>]. </li>
      <li> The high interfacial energy is compensated by forming 
        low-density water. </li>
      <li>The elasticity of water's hydrogen-bonded network surrounds or squeezes out hydrophobic molecules dependent on their size and how well they can be accommodated within its network [<a name="r507" id="r507"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r507">507</a>].</li>
      <li>The water surrounding hydrophobic molecules is held more firmly as there are fewer competing and reorienting hydrogen bonds [<a name="r3874" id="r3874"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref39.html#r3874">3874</a>].</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Where low-density water (LDW) overlays hydrophobic surfaces, 
      there will be a tendency for surface minimization by surfaces 
      interacting and excluding water, causing  
      junction zones to form  in many <a href="hydrocolloids_gums.html">hydrocolloids</a>. 
      It is the incompatibility between the <abbr title="lower density water">LDW</abbr> and the hydrophobic surface that drives the structure formation. 
      The formation of low-density water adjacent   to hydrophobic surfaces 
      and concomitant junction zone formation are encouraged if 
      this low-density water is also associated with high-density 
      water created near to additional solute polar groups (for example, in <a href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#polar">polysaccharides</a>).  It is likely  that local 
      weak water-water hydrogen-bonding (and hence greater availability of water molecules) will discourage such junction zone formation because of its greater hydration capacity. Alternatively, 
      local strong hydrogen-bonding may be able to create low-density 
      water without assistance.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The hydrophobic effect decreases with increased pressure (or 
      density) as it is dependent on the presence of tetrahedrally-placed 
      water molecules (as in LDW), which reduce in number under 
      the distorting influence of pressure [<a  href="ref7.html#r626" name="r626" title="go to cited reference" id="r626">626</a>]. Although the actual densities of crystalline-like (often called &quot;ice-like&quot; but not closely related to hexagonal ice) structures at hydrophobic surfaces have been found to be negligible at ambient pressure, it significantly grows with increasing pressure. This is contrary to that of bulk hexagonal ice, which is destabilized by elevated pressure. At 100 MPa, interfacial water has a significantly crystalline-like order [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3471">3471</a><a name="r3471" id="r3471"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In cold water, the hydrophobic effect increases with increasing temperature (that is, hydrophobic molecules become more sticky) due to the reduced ease of clathrate formation, increasing the energetic cost of the hydrophobe-water surface and reducing the hydrophobe-surface hydration.

      Hydrophobic versus hydrophilic interfaces</h2>
    <p>Water on surfaces may form droplets. The shape of the surface droplets depends on the interaction between the water and the surface. The best way to characterize this interaction is by means of the contact angle (&theta;, see right), with &theta; &lt; 90&deg; indicating hydrophilic surfaces and &theta; &gt; 90&deg; indicating hydrophobic surfaces [<a  href="ref27.html#r2624" name="r2624" title="go to cited reference" id="r2624">2624</a>].<sup><a href="#i" name="bi" id="bi">i</a></sup> If the drop is drawn off from the surface water on hydrophilic surfaces, it leaves a small residual droplet, whereas if the drop is drawn off from the surface water on hydrophobic surfaces, it leaves no residual droplet (see right). The rationale is that water interacts more strongly with itself than with hydrophobic surfaces and more strongly with the hydrophilic surfaces than itself. This does not mean that water does not interact with hydrophobic surfaces at all, with the relative interactions given by the contact angle. It certainly does not mean that hydrophobic surfaces 'repel' water; a misconception often propagated in the literature. As examples of hydrophobic and  hydrophilic surfaces,  </p>

    Contact angles greater than 150&deg; indicate a superhydrophobic surface with effectively zero interaction between the surface and water. Superhydrophobic surfaces can also be produced by nano-patterning (texturing) a hydrophobic surface, such as occurs on lotus leaves (see right), butterfly wings, and duck feathers [<a  href="ref27.html#r2625" name="r2625" title="go to cited reference" id="r2625">2625</a>].

    <p>Superhydrophilic surfaces with zero contact angle (complete spreading due to wicking within the roughness or pores of the surface) can also be found due to the nano-patterning (texturing) of hydrophilic surfaces [<a  href="ref27.html#r2626" name="r2626" title="go to cited reference" id="r2626">2626</a>]. Superhydrophilic coatings (e.g., TiO<sub>2</sub> ) are useful, for example, by creating anti-fogging properties in the glass. Robust  graphene-based composite coatings are  superhydrophobic, robust, and self-cleaning [<a  href="ref30.html#r2909" name="r2909" title="go to cited reference" id="r2909">2909</a>]. The compressed air beneath such surfaces on impalement by aqueous droplets has been shown to be critical for its superhydrophobic effect    [<a href="ref42.html#r4146" name="r4146" title="go to cited reference" id="r4146">4146</a>] and of importance to the aviation industry. Some microstructured and nanostructured surfaces, such as  red rose petals are both highly adhesive to water and superhydrophobic. Water droplets on their surfaces are  spherical  but do not  roll off; (the &ldquo;petal effect&rdquo;) in contrast with the &ldquo;lotus effect&rdquo; (see above right) where droplets quickly move across the surface  [<a  href="ref33.html#r3217" name="r3217" title="go to cited reference" id="r3217">3217</a>], slowed mainly by the aerodynamic resistance [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r3586">3586</a><a name="r3586" id="r3586"></a>].

    <h2><a name="long" id="long"></a>Extensive hydrophobic interfaces </h2>
    <p>Hydrogen-bonding  governs the interfaces of small  hydrophobic solutes. However, the interfacial structure around large hydrophobic solutes and  extensive hydrophobic surfaces also depends on longer-ranged electrostatic and dispersion interactions  [<a  href="ref30.html#r2931" name="r2931" title="go to cited reference" id="r2931">2931</a>]. Hydrophobic surfaces, such as those found with carbon, may include many hydrophilic groups such as ketones and carboxylates that can hydrogen bond to water and control their hydration [<a  href="ref32.html#r3114" name="r3114" title="go to cited reference" id="r3114">3114</a>]. Even apparently hydrophobic surfaces such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) may become covered in a thin liquid water film   [<a  href="ref34.html#r3342" name="r3342" title="go to cited reference" id="r3342">3342</a>], as can be shown by the strong attachment of a damp sandwich of polyethylene films. The behavior of liquid water at hydrophobic solid surfaces and <a title="go to find more information"  href="interfacial_water.html">vapor interfaces</a> is influenced 
      by the necessary presence of dangling non-hydrogen-bonded 
      surface O-H groups when the clathrate structures can no longer 
      form (that is, particles &#8811; 0.6- 0.7 nm diameter<sup><a href="#e" name="be" id="be"> e</a></sup> at ambient temperatures), 
      which are necessarily compensated by stronger hydrogen-bonding 
      towards the bulk [<a  href="ref3.html#r213" name="r213" title="go to cited reference" id="r213">213</a>].

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The drive to maximize hydrogen bonding by forming empty dome-shaped half-clathrate structures is compensated by the tendency to fill the empty space and increase entropy. The surface roughness of sub-nano dimensions increases the hydration   [<a  href="ref33.html#r3271" name="r3271" title="go to cited reference" id="r3271">3271</a>]. Overall, this is expected to cause dynamic sub-nanometer waves at the surface. 
      Dissolved N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> gases reduce the 
      hydrophobic surface density more than dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> gas and much more than Ar [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r890">890</a><a name="r890" id="r890"></a>]; indicating that Ar is very soluble at these interfaces forming clathrate structuring, but the other gases establish a thin gaseous phase. 
      The character of this reduced density surface, in the presence 
      of accumulated gas, is not clear with some evidence that it has a fluctuating density 
      (between that of vapor and liquid), without the sharp density 
      transition that may have been expected of discrete nanobubbles (nanocavities)
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r890">890</a>] and other evidence for the presence of the <a  title="go for more information"  href="nanobubble.html">nanobubbles</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r506">506</a><a name="r506" id="r506"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r519">519</a><a name="r519" id="r519"></a>]. Under reduced or <a href="ice_xvi.html#a" title="go for more explanation">negative pressure</a>, such surface gas may expand into visible bubbles (cavities) 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r891">891</a><a name="r891" id="r891"></a>]. Molecularly-flat hydrophobic surfaces show the low-density layer but without large nanobubbles (nanocavities) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1175">1175</a><a name="r1175" id="r1175"></a>]. It seems likely that hydroxide ions may prefer the aqueous environment next to hydrophobic surfaces [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref14.html#r1347">1347</a><a name="r1347" id="r1347"></a>] in much the same way as occurs at <a  title="go for more information" href="interfacial_water.html">gas-water interfaces</a> and easing the formation of <a  title="go for more information" href="nanobubble.html">nanobubbles</a>. Also, the presence of  carbon dioxide  forms carbonate and bicarbonate ions that have  an affinity for aqueous/hydrophobic surfaces endowing  further negative charges  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3209">3209</a><a name="r3209" id="r3209"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3304">3304</a><a name="r3304" id="r3304"></a>]. Thus the surface charge and zeta potential at extensive hydrophobe-water interfaces are negative. Strangely, surfaces covered in a monolayer of water may act as a hydrophobic surface if the water layer is strongly arranged, minimizing hydrogen-bonding contact [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref25.html#r2421">2421</a><a name="r2421" id="r2421"></a>]. The interfacial water structure is greatly influenced by any surface charge, greatly influencing any surface flow. Cations are attracted towards  negatively charged graphene, so increasing the interfacial friction and slowing any interfacial flow.   In contrast, if the surface is positively charged, high surface charge density triggers halide ion binding and  increases  any electroosmotic flow beyond the surface layer [<a href="ref34.html#r3398" name="r3398" title="go to cited reference" id="r3398">3398</a>]. Changing the charge causes an abrupt change of the interfacial water structure and <a href="interfacial_water.html#b">zeta potential</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Long-range attractive effects occur between hydrophobic surfaces and also between hydrophilic and charged surfaces. These may be due to bridging nanoscopic gas cavities [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r629">629</a><a name="r629" id="r629"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r711">711</a><a name="r711" id="r711"></a>] or the osmotic effect due to local nanobubble depletion [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1433">1433</a><a name="r1433" id="r1433"></a>]. Also, they may 
      be caused by the organization<sup><a href="#d" name="bd" id="bd"> d</a></sup> within the water network. For a review, see [<a  href="ref3.html#r235" name="r235" title="go to cited reference" id="r235">235</a>], for

      between such close hydrophobic surfaces possesses  physical 
      changes associated with increased hydrogen bond organization,

      Although these long-range effects may be lost on the removal of 
      dissolved gas,<sup><a href="#b" name="bb" id="bb"> b</a></sup> a shorter

An  attractive short-range force between hydrophobic surfaces in the absence of bridging bubbles but in the presence of dissolved gas, is  stronger than the van der Waals attraction alone [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref41.html#r4047">4047</a><a name="r4047" id="r4047"></a>].

      However, the solubility  of such compounds in water 
      is complicated by entropic factors due to their size or 
      charge plus specific structural effects.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#c"> c</a><a name="bc" id="bc"></a></sup> The cavity radius around hydrophobic polycyclic aromatics 
      remains constant between 23&nbsp;&deg;C and 90&nbsp;&deg;C, indicating

      hydrogen bonds [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r510">510</a><a name="r510" id="r510"></a>]

      Indeed, if an optimal clathrate structuring is formed, there will be only a third as many hydrogen bonds between water molecules in the first and second shells as within the shells, as shown by the <a title="go to find more information"   href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#Fig5">connectivity map</a>.  Hydrogen-bonding may be weaker outside of this first shell [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r794">794</a>], 
      due perhaps to the pressure-volume work and the necessarily reduced entropy. This means that water molecules within the hydration 
      shell possess stronger (within the shell) and more broken 
      (to the outside of the shell) hydrogen bonds. As the specific heat (C<sub>P</sub>) 
      is proportional to&nbsp;&lt;(&delta;H)<sup>2</sup>&gt;<sub>TPN</sub> (that is, enthalpy fluctuations squared), this still 
      results in increased heat capacity change (<em>i.e., </em>+&Delta;C<sub>P</sub>). Where the hydrophobic molecule is at high concentrations and fewer water molecules are available, the dynamics within the first (clathrate) hydration sphere becomes highly suppressed with  only the rotational motions attributed to the hydrophobic group(s) allowed [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1424">1424</a><a name="r1424" id="r1424"></a>]. The solubility of  larger volatile organic (i.e., hydrophobic) compounds increases as the solution is called towards 0&nbsp;&deg;C but then undergoes a change on supercooling the solution. Then, their solubility decreases with decreasing temperature [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1590">1590</a><a name="r1590" id="r1590"></a>]. This is likely

    <p>Diffusion of hydrophobic solutes in supercooled water employs cage-to-cage jumps, with the solute rattling around in one clathrate-like cage before quickly moving to another.

An interesting hydrotrope is ATP that exerts this effect at millimolar concentrations while acting as an energy source at micromolar concentrations [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2902">2902</a><a name="r2902" id="r2902"></a>]. </p>

    <h2><a name="salt" id="salt"></a>Salting-out and salting-in </h2>
    <p>Salting-in and salting-out processes have been reviewed [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref10.html#r926">926</a><a name="r926" id="r926"></a>]. Salt solutions have been used both to stabilize and destabilize hydrophobic surfaces causing  molecules with sufficient nonpolar character to become more (salting-in) or less (salting-out) soluble (see also the <a title="go to find more on ionic effects" href="hofmeister_series.html#b">Hofmeister series</a>). Recent molecular dynamics simulations have confirmed the importance of the surface charge density of the ions on the process [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1243">1243a</a><a name="r1243" id="r1243"></a>]. They report salting-out as being  entropically-driven
      by ions with   high charge density (the effect increasing with charge density [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1243">1243b</a>]), and less polarizability, that forms strong hydration complexes away from  the hydrophobic surfaces, whereas salting-in, is caused by  ions with  lower charge density, and greater polarizability, that 
      exhibit preferential binding at the hydrophobic surfaces and stabilized by entropic or enthalpic effects. At lower concentrations, ions with  lower charge density  can also increase  hydrophobic aggregation of hydrophobic particles, stabilizing &ldquo;micelle-like&rdquo; structures but, with increasing salt concentration the micellar particles disperse rather than aggregate further [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1243">1243b</a>], due to a greater ionic charge being better spread over their more extensive surface area.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The   '<a title="go to find more on ionic effects" href="hofmeister_series.html#b">salting-out</a>' 
      mechanism (phase separation of amphiphilic molecules from aqueous solution) 
      has been further studied using NaCl and <em>t</em>-butanol [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r550">550a</a><a name="r550" id="r550"></a>]. 
      At low concentrations, <em>t</em>-butanol is hydrated by a clathrate-like cage of about 20 water molecules [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1239">1239</a><a name="r1239" id="r1239"></a>]. In a relatively concentrated solution, the <em>t</em>-butanol molecules 
      tend to form loose dimers through hydrophobic interactions 
      of their methyl groups with no noticeable interaction between 
      their alcohol groups (spectroscopically confirmed [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r952">952</a><a name="r952" id="r952"></a>]). 
      The introduction of NaCl causes the further interaction of the 
      butanol residues indirectly through their alcohol groups 
      due to their mutual interaction with the anions (Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>), 
       increasing both the tendency for further amphiphile clustering 
      and the tendency for phase separation. The conclusions of this 
      work [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r550">550a</a>], indicating the importance 
      of the anion rather than the cation in such salting-out phenomena, 
      have been (inconclusively) challenged [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r550">550c</a>]. Pairs of methane, neopentane, adamantane, fullerene, ethane, propane,  butane, hexane, octane, and decane have been simulated by molecular dynamics in salt solutions. It was found that they bind more tightly in more concentrated salt solutions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4174">41749</a><a name="r4174" id="r4174"></a>].</p>

    <p>Protein 'salting 
      out' results from the interfacial effects of strongly 
      hydrated anions near the protein surface,  removing 
      water molecules from protein solvation and dehydrating 
      the surface. The greatest effect is due to the most 
      strongly hydrated anions. Protein 'salting in' (solubility 
      increase on the addition of low salt levels ) results 
      from protein-counter-ion binding and the consequent 
      higher net protein charge and solvation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r667">667</a>]<a name="r667" id="r667"></a>. Salting-in occurs where the protein has little net charge near its isoelectric point [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1554">1554</a><a name="r1554" id="r2"></a>]. In this case, the most significant effect is due to the most 
      weakly hydrated anions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Salting out follows the Hofmeister series above the isoelectric point for some proteins, including lysozyme, but follows the reverse order below the isoelectric point [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1535">1535</a><a name="r1535" id="r1535"></a>]. The activity of lysozyme also follows the Hofmeister series [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2926">2926</a><a name="r2926" id="r2926"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many 'insoluble' proteins can be dissolved in pure water if the pH is away from the isoelectric point  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1554">1554</a>]. Here the charged protein molecules repel each other, with hydrophobic areas covered with an organized low-density water network so avoiding protein-protein interactions. In these cases, the addition of ions reduces the repulsions and water organization, so resulting in protein precipitation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1554">1554</a>]. </p>

    <p><a name="a" id="a"></a><sup>a</sup> In contrast, interfaces involving 
      moderately (but not extremely) hydrophobic liquids (for example, CCl<sub>4</sub>) have residual (for example, <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> interactions) and fluid interactions between the interfacial 
      molecules, so reducing the water-water hydrogen-bonding within 
      interfacial water [<a  href="ref3.html#r214" name="r214" title="go to cited reference" id="r214">214</a>]. 
      This effect can also be found at lipid bilayers, where there is sufficient water penetration to allow its passage across [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1425">1425</a><a name="r1425" id="r1425"></a>].

    <p><sup>c<a name="c" id="c"></a></sup> There is still some debate over the situation concerning methane [<a href="ref13.html#r1276" name="r1276" title="go to cited reference" id="r1276">1276</a>]. There is evidence that the hydrophobic molecule methane can be accommodated within the 
      normal structure of water without significant local ordering 
      around the methane molecules [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r853">853</a><a name="r853" id="r853"></a>]. It should be noted that methane is a very small molecule, being similar in size to a water molecule and only poorly fits into more capacious empty water clathrate cages, endowing it with little stability from collapsing puckering. Neutron diffraction  indicates that the water may be forming a clathrate shell of about 19 water molecules around methane [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref14.html#r1356">1356</a><a name="r1356" id="r1356"></a>].  Also, partial clathrate cages are found using molecular dynamics and increase in size with lowered temperature [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1460">1460</a><a name="r1460" id="r1460"></a>].

    <p><sup>d<a name="d" id="d"></a></sup> The very long-range interaction may be due to either the very strong forces involved in cavitation (that is, <a href="#dry">a drying transition</a>) of the intervening water introduced during measurement [<a  title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1073">1073</a><a name="r1073" id="r1073"></a>] or the weaker osmotic effects [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1433">1433</a>].

Young's equation (a thermodynamic equilibrium condition) reduces to the forces acting along the contact line between the water, gas, and solid as all these surface energies act along the same length of contact line (see right). The interfacial free energies between the solid and gas, solid and liquid, and liquid and gas are &gamma;<sub>SG</sub>, &gamma;<sub>SL</sub>, and &gamma;<sub>LG</sub> respectively.  &gamma;<sub>SG</sub> and &gamma;<sub>SL</sub> are generally difficult to determine. </p>
