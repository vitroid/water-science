    <h2><a name="def" id="def"></a>Definitions of kosmotropes 
      and chaotropes</h2>
    <p align="left">The terms 'kosmotrope' (from Greek &kappa;&omicron;&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;, order) and 'chaotrope' 
      (from Greek &chi;&alpha;&omicron;&sigmaf;, disorder) originally denoted solutes that stabilized, 
      or destabilized respectively, <a href="protein_denatured.html" title="go to more on proteins" >proteins</a> and membranes. Chaotropes unfold proteins, destabilize hydrophobic aggregates and increase the solubility of hydrophobes, whereas kosmotropes stabilize proteins and hydrophobic aggregates in solution and reduce the solubility of hydrophobes. A 2015 review makes a strong case for reverting to these meanings [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2361">2361</a><a name="r2361" id="r2361"></a>]. However, with most contemporary literature using these terms to refer to the apparently correlating 
      properties of increasing or decreasing respectively, the structuring 
      of water (a review of structure-making and structure-breaking ions has been presented  [<a href="ref16.html#r1567" name="r1567" title="go to cited reference" id="r1567">1567</a>]). </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">In 2014, the terms kosmotropes 
      and chaotropes were quantified in terms of hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2212">2212</a><a name="r2212" id="r2212"></a>]. Although useful, the terminology may sometimes be 
      misleading as such properties may vary depending on the circumstances, 
      the method of determination, or the solvation shell(s) investigated. 
      For example, a solute may not always act in the same way at 
      different concentrations or in the presence of macromolecules 
      or gels [<a href="ref3.html#r276" name="r276" title="go to cited reference" id="r276">276</a>]. Also, 
      some solutes with less well-defined properties (for example, urea) are sometimes classified as kosmotropes [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref3.html#r276">276</a>] 
      and sometimes as chaotropes [<a href="ref3.html#r283" name="r283" title="go to cited reference" id="r283">283</a>].      Univalent ions are bound with different strength to the headgroups of surfactant dimers   [<a href="ref39.html#r3812" name="r3812" title="go to cited reference" id="r3812">3812</a>]</p>

    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> and this ion specificity observed is mainly related to the kosmotropic and chaotropic properties of ions.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">An alternative term used for kosmotrope is 'compensatory solute' 
      as they have been found to compensate for the deleterious 
      effects of high salt or high chaotrope contents [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref26.html#r2513">2513</a><a name="r2513" id="r2513"></a>], which destroy the natural hydrogen-bonded network of water in osmotically stressed cells. However, behavior as a kosmotrope in one system does not mean 
      that a solute may behave as a 'compensatory solute'&nbsp;in 
      another or even stabilize the structuring of 
      water in a third. Both the extent and strength of <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen 
      bonding</a> may be changed independently by the solute, but 
      either of these  has been used as measures of 
      order-making. It is, however, the effects on the extent of 
      quality hydrogen-bonding that is of overriding importance 
      as true kosmotropes shift the local equilibrium,</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center">less 
      dense water (for example, <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>) <img border="0" src="images/rarrow.gif" width="20" height="12"  alt="reversible arrow" /> more dense water (for example, <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> to the left, and chaotropes shift it to the right. 
      The ordering effects of kosmotropes may be confused by their 
      diffusional rotation, creating more extensive disorganized 
      junction zones of greater disorder with the surrounding bulk 
      water than less hydrated chaotropes. It seems clear that most 
      kosmotropes do not cause a significant net structuring in 
      water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r595">595</a><a name="r595" id="r595"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Temperature and pressure both affect the kosmotropic/chaotropic status, with the effects disappearing at high temperatures, particularly at high concentrations [<a href="ref12.html#r1170" name="r1170" title="go to cited reference" id="r1170">1170</a>]. For example, at very high pressures (0.6 GPa), Na<sup>+</sup> ions change from being weak kosmotropes into weak chaotropes as their  links to water molecules are preferably broken [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1170">1170</a>].&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">It is possible to extend from kosmotropes to chaotropes and into the realm of <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#hydrotrope">hydrotropes</a> (structure-disrupting ions and surfactants). </p>

    <p align="left">Ionic kosmotropes<sup><a href="#a" name="ba" id="ba"> a</a></sup> should be treated differently from nonionic kosmotropes, 
      due mainly to the directed and polarized arrangements of the

They are best not described as 'structure-makers' or 'structure-breakers' in terms of their effects on the properties of water outside their immediate solvation shells [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1389">1389</a><a name="r1389" id="r1389"></a>].

    <p>Generally, ionic behavior parallels 
      the <a title="go to find more on ionic effects" href="hofmeister_series.html">Hofmeister series</a>. Large singly 
      charged ions, with low charge density (for example, Ph<sub>4</sub>B<sup>&minus; </sup>(tetraphenylborate anion), Ph<sub>4</sub>As<sup>+</sup> (tetraphenylarsonium cation), SCN<sup>&minus;</sup>, 
      H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>,

      with water than water with itself and thus interfering little 
      in the hydrogen-bonding of the surrounding water), are chaotropes. So-called superchaotropic ions, such as the large hydrophilic (0.7 nm diameter dodecahedral) dodecaborate [B<sub>12</sub>H<sub>12</sub>]<sup>2&minus;</sup> anion (dodecahydridododecaborate) or a polyoxometalate (POM, e.g., &alpha;-keggin, [PW<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]<sup>3&minus;</sup>, 1.1 nm diameter cuboctahedral), lie to the left of the green end of the diagram [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref40.html#r3927">3927</a><a name="r3927" id="r3927"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref41.html#r4064">4064</a><a name="r4064" id="r4064"></a>]. </p>

    <p>Dodecaborates (see right) and POMs (see left) are super-chaotropes due to their large size and delocalized charge (e.g., the PW<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>]<sup>3&minus;</sup> anion has a low surface charge density of 6.5 e<sup>&minus;</sup>  &#739; nm<sup>&minus;3</sup>) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref40.html#r3928">3928</a><a name="r3928" id="r3928"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Small or multiply-charged ions, with high charge density, 
      are kosmotropes (for example, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>, 
      HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 
      Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>, OH<sup>&minus;</sup> and HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>,<sup> </sup>exhibiting stronger 
      interactions with water molecules than water with itself and 
      therefore capable of breaking water-water hydrogen bonds).<sup><a href="#b" name="bb" id="bb"> b</a></sup> The <a href="hofmeister_series.html#e">Jones-Dole coefficient</a> has also been used to classify ionic kosmotropes and chaotropes with  negative <em><strong>B</strong></em> coefficients indicating chaotropes and positive <em><strong>B</strong></em> coefficients indicating kosmotropes. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Kosmotropes remain hydrated near the water surface, while the chaotropes lose their hydration sheath  
      [<a href="ref17.html#r1663" name="r1663" title="go to cited reference" id="r1663">1663</a>]. The radii of singly charged chaotropic ions are greater than 
      1.06 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> for cations and greater than 1.78 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> for anions 
      [<a href="ref3.html#r284" name="r284" title="go to cited reference" id="r284">284</a>]. Thus the hydrogen 
      bonding between water molecules is more broken in the immediate 
      vicinity of ionic kosmotropes than ionic chaotropes   
      [<a href="ref21.html#r2046" name="r2046" title="go to cited reference" id="r2046">2046</a>]. Reinforcing 
      this conclusion, a Raman spectroscopic study of the hydrogen-bonded 
      structure of water around the halide ions F<sup>&minus;</sup>, Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>, 
      Br<sup>&minus;</sup> and <span class="style1">I</span><sup>&minus;</sup> indicates that the total extent of aqueous hydrogen-bonding 
      increases with increasing ionic size [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r685">685</a><a name="r685" id="r685"></a>] 
      and an IR study in HDO:D<sub>2</sub>O showed slow hydrogen bond reorientation 
      around these halide ions getting slower with respect to increasing 
      size [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref9.html#r895">895</a><a name="r895" id="r895"></a>]. 
      It is not unreasonable that a solute may strengthen some of 
      the hydrogen bonds surrounding it (structure making; for example, kosmotropic cations will enhance the hydrogen bonds donated 
      by the inner shell water molecules) while at the same time 
      breaking some other hydrogen bonds (structure breaker; for example, kosmotropic cations will weaken the hydrogen bonds accepted 
      by the inner shell water molecules) [<a href="ref3.html#r274" name="r274" title="go to cited reference" id="r274">274</a>], 
      so adding to the confusion in nomenclature. Kosmotropic ions such as Na<sup>+</sup> reduce the average diffusion of water by slightly less than that expected if the hydrated water was not diffusionally-active  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2001">2001</a><a name="r2001" id="r2001"></a>]. Using a method that links the self-diffusion of water to its reorientational motion, it has been shown that chaotropic  ions preferentially bind to, and thus stabilize, the transition state of water motion enabling diffusion [<a  href="ref33.html#r3206" name="r3206" title="go to cited reference" id="r3206">3206</a>]. Kosmotropic  ions suppress the formation of this transition state, so slowing diffusion  [<a  href="ref33.html#r3206" title="go to cited reference" >3206</a>].</p>
   
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> Much local organization around a solute is entropically compensated by the reduced organization between the water molecules further away [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2087">2087</a><a name="r2087" id="r2087"></a>], such that  K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> (and Ar) have almost identical hydration entropies [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1495">1495</a><a name="r1495" id="r1495"></a>]. Other factors 
      being equal, water molecules are held more strongly by molecules 
      with a net charge than by molecules with no net charge, as 
      shown by the difference between zwitterionic and cationic 
      amino acids [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r532">532</a><a name="r532" id="r532"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Somewhat surprisingly, chaotropic ions such as K<sup>+</sup> slightly increase the average diffusion of water at moderate to high concentrations (0.25 - 2 M) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2001">2001</a>], showing that they have a net destructive effect on the structuring in water at these concentrations. Weakly hydrated ions (chaotropes, K<sup>+</sup>, 
      Rb<sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, Br<sup>&minus;</sup>, <span class="style1">I</span><sup>&minus;</sup>, 
      guanidinium<sup>+</sup>) may be 'pushed' onto poorly hydrated 
      surfaces by strong water-water interactions with the transition 
      from strong ionic hydration to weak ionic hydration occurring 
      where the strength of the ion-water hydration approximately 
      equals the strength of water-water interactions in bulk solution 
      (with Na<sup>+</sup> being borderline on the strong side and 
      Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> being borderline on the weak side) [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref3.html#r284">284</a>]. Strongly hydrated surfaces, where the water molecules are prevented from forming <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>-like expanded water clusters, favors strongly hydrated kosmotropic ions and effectively repels weakly hydrated chaotropic ions  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1726">1726</a><a name="r1726" id="r1726"></a>]. Neutron diffraction studies on two important chaotropes (guanidinium 
      and thiocyanate ions) show their very poor hydration, supporting 
      the suggestion that they preferentially interact with the 
      protein rather than the water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref5.html#r488">488</a><a name="r488" id="r488"></a>]. 
      In contrast to the kosmotropes, there is little significant 
      difference between the properties of ionic and nonionic chaotropes 
      due to the low charge density of the former.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The optimum stabilization of biological macromolecule 
      by salt requires a mixture of a kosmotropic anion with a chaotropic 
      cation. As ionic kosmotropes primarily achieve their increased 
      structuring solely within their hydration shell, they partition 
      into the more dense (<abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>) 
      water where they can obtain this hydration water more readily. In contrast, the ionic chaotropes, by avoiding interference with 
      water's hydrogen-bonded network, tend to clathrate formation 
      within the less dense (<abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>) 
      environment. Thus there is agreement with the defining characteristic 
      of an ionic chaotrope in that it partitions selectively into 
      low-density water, whereas a kosmotrope partitions selectively 
      into high-density water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref3.html#r276">276</a>]. 
      
      The stabilizing of structured low-density water (by ionic chaotropes) in turn stabilizes 
      the hydration shell around lower molecular mass hydrophobes, as seen in the promoted association of polyene antibiotics by ionic kosmotropes and the stabilization of their solution by ionic chaotropes [<a href="ref11.html#r1030">1030</a><a name="r1030" id="r1030"></a>].&nbsp;</p>

    <h2><a name="non" id="non"></a>Nonionic kosmotropes and chaotropes </h2>
    <p>Nonionic kosmotropes are very soluble well-hydrated molecules 
      with little tendency to aggregate, having no net charge and 
      strongly hydrogen-bonding to water, that stabilize the structure 
      of macromolecules in solution. They are preferentially solubilized 
      within the bulk of the solution and excluded from the solvation 
      layers of macromolecular surfaces. Consequentially, they decrease 
      the water diffusion around the proteins and the exchange rate 
      of backbone amide protons [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r621">621</a><a name="r621" id="r621"></a>]. 
      This leads to the dehydration of such surfaces and ensures 
      that they are less flexible and therefore more thermally stable 
      but less enzymatically active.<sup><a href="#c" name="bc" id="bc"> c</a></sup> Kosmotropes reduce the volume of water available to hydrate 
      the larger surface exposed by denatured proteins,  tending 
      to prevent the denaturation process (the 'excluded volume' 
      effect). These kosmotropes may be divided into two groups which 
      act somewhat differently: (1) polyhydroxy compounds fit in 
      well with the hydrogen-bonding arrangements but stabilize 
      any cluster 'flickering' between  a continuum of hydrogen bond rearrangements, 
      as their hydroxyl groups are similarly separated to water-water 
      separations (see <a href="sugar_hydration.html" title="go to sugar hydration page">sugar hydration</a>), 
      and (2) zwitterions where the balance between hydrophilicity,<sup><a href="#f" name="bf" id="bf"> f</a></sup> hydrophobicity,<sup><a href="#f"> f</a></sup> anionic, and cationic characteristics ensures 
      good solubility but forming only weak net interactions to the surrounding 
      water. Many, if not all, such kosmotropes are also useful as cryoprotectants (see<a href="#cryo"> below</a>).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Chaotropes break down the hydrogen-bonded network of water, 
      so allowing macromolecules more structural freedom and encouraging 
      protein extension and denaturation. Kosmotropes are stabilizing 
      solutes that increase the order of water (such as polyhydric 
      alcohols [<a href="ref4.html#r307" name="r307" title="go to cited reference" id="r307">307</a>], trehalose, 
      trimethylamine <em>N</em>-oxide, glycine betaine, ectoine, 
      proline, taurine  [<a href="ref32.html#r3185" name="r3185" title="go to cited reference" id="r3185">3185</a>], and various other zwitterions). In contrast, chaotropes 
      create weaker hydrogen-bonding, decreasing the order of water, 
      increasing its surface tension (but see <a title="go to find more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#JR">anomaly</a>) 
      and destabilizing macromolecular structures (such as guanidinium 
      chloride and urea at high concentrations).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Glucose  acts as a kosmotrope, enhancing both hydrogen-bonding and hydrophobic 
      interactions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref3.html#r283">283</a>]. Somewhat unexpectedly, whereas L-amino acids and D-glucose 
      prefer a less dense (<abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>)

      a consequence of which may be that condensed polymers of the

    <p>Urea (H<sub>2</sub>NCONH<sub>2</sub>; carbonic diamide) is of particular interest because of its interactions with proteins. It can only strongly bind one water molecule  using two hydrogen bonds, donating from a nitrogen atom and accepting onto the urea oxygen atom  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1130">1130</a><a name="r1130" id="r1130"></a>] but will also hydrogen bond more weakly to about 4 - 7 moles further water molecules per molecule of urea. Otherwise, it can make a hydrogen bond to itself (see (b) opposite), or water with close to equal ease, and hydrogen bonds to water slightly weaker than water to itself but seems to increase the water-water interactions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1233">1233</a><a name="r1233" id="r1233"></a>].

    <p>Thermodiffusion (the Soret effect)<sup><a href="#h" name="bh" id="bh"> h</a></sup> is a sensitive method for investigating a solute's hydration. Thermal diffusion measurements of urea/water solutions show a change between low concentrations (positive Soret coefficient, higher hydrophilicity with urea more concentrated near the cold end than near the hot end) and high concentrations (negative Soret coefficient, higher hydrophobicity). The transition between these two regimes is observed in urea solutions at a concentration of around 30% by weight (5.4 M) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3125">3125</a><a name="r3125" id="r3125"></a>].</p>

    <p> Urea with small clusters of water molecules has been modeled (see the almost planar cluster left) [<a href="ref25.html#r2461" name="r2461" title="go to cited reference" id="r2461">2461</a>]. Other work has

      interactions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref3.html#r283">283</a>].  The idiosyncratic 
      behavior of urea may well be due to its concentration-dependent 
      nose-to-tail oligomerization (where the carbonyl group of one urea molecule accepts two hydrogen bonds to the two amines of the next urea molecule); cyclic hydrogen-bonding dimers and oligomers 
      behaving differently from monomers [<a href="ref4.html#r364" name="r364" title="go to cited reference" id="r364">364</a>] and the system becoming more organized with increasing urea concentration [<a href="ref25.html#r2451" name="r2451" title="go to cited reference" id="r2451">2451</a>].<a name="dimer" id="dimer"></a></p>

      and hence more able to interact with further sites on the 
      protein, leading to localized dehydration-led denaturation (i.e., urea is preferred over water for binding to the protein backbone so leading to protein denaturation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1711">1711</a><a name="r1711" id="r1711"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2324">2324</a><a name="r2324" id="r2324"></a>]). By replacing and removing the water from the protein surface, urea acts  oppositely, in denaturing proteins, to increased pressure [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2324">2324</a>]. The effect of pressure on the hydrogen bonding in urea solutions has been examined using <a href="water_methods.html#tera">THz spectroscopy</a>.

      around its edge (see right) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2188">2188</a><a name="r2188" id="r2188"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3799">3799</a><a name="r3799" id="r3799"></a>]. However, it may establish strongly-held hydrogen-bonded 
      ion-pairs to protein carboxylate groups, like commonly found 
      quaternary structural arginine-carboxylate 'salt' links. The spread-out positive   charge  causes the nitrogen atoms to be poor hydrogen-bond acceptors. Also, 
      guanidinium possesses rather hydrophobic surfaces that may 
      interact with similar protein surfaces to enable protein denaturation 
      [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r571">571</a><a name="r571" id="r571"></a>]. Likewise, they have a preference for water/air surfaces [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2197">2197</a><a name="r2197" id="r2197"></a>]. </p>

    <p>The hydrophobic surfaces also allow the formation of contact guanidinium-guanidinium ion-pairing  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2034">2034</a><a name="r2034" id="r2034"></a>] and the similar contact guanidinium-arginine ion-pairing   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2199">2199</a><a name="r2199" id="r2199"></a>] with the  repulsion of the like, if somewhat dispersed, positive charges being compensated by the increased entropy and enthalpy of the released water molecules from the surfaces on forming the stacked pair. The effect of temperature [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3069">3069</a><a name="r3069" id="r3069"></a>]  on guanidinium solutions has been described as being weak. The action of guanidinium is highly dependent upon the concentration and counter-anion with which it was paired. As an example, the  salting-out efficacy at low salt concentrations is as follows    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2856">2856</a><a name="r2856" id="r2856"></a>]:</p>

    <p> Both 
      denaturants (urea and guanidinium) may cause protein swelling and destructuring by 
      sliding between hydrophobic sites and dragging 
      in hydrogen-bound water to complete the denaturation. The hydration of the counterion is important to the action of guanidinium with chloride ions, being only weakly hydrated, allowing the water molecules to easily rearrange around the surface and allowing the denaturation process outlined above. In contrast, sulfate ions hold on to their water molecules very strongly, preventing the water rearrangement and hence preventing the guanidinium-protein interactions and consequent denaturation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1747">1747</a><a name="r1747" id="r1747"></a>].</p>

      The &alpha;, &beta;- and &beta;, &beta;-trehaloses are not naturally found. Trehalose has a much more

    <p align="left">Sucrose is a stabilizing molecule but less efficient than trehalose as trehalose perturbs the water structure slightly more than sucrose [<a href="ref40.html#r3995" name="r3995" title="go to cited reference" id="r3995">3995</a>]. Both inelastic neutron scattering [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r543">543</a><a name="r543" id="r543"></a>] 
      and <sup>17</sup>O-NMR show that a rotational restriction

      is definitely a net water-structurer. These stronger interactions<sup><a href="#d" name="bd" id="bd"> d</a></sup> (between the trehalose and water compared to water-water interactions) 
      increase the bioprotective effectiveness of trehalose [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref9.html#r887">887</a><a name="r887" id="r887"></a>] by preserving  the protein hydration-shell    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3236">3236</a><a name="r3236" id="r3236"></a>], 
    by reducing the (re-)activity of the water molecules, and by creating a rigid shell around biomolecules and so reducing thermal stress [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1319">1319</a><a name="r1319" id="r1319"></a>]. This effect is increased by the introduction of greater static hydration with trehalose-trehalose interactions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1920">1920</a><a name="r1920" id="r1920"></a>]. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">However, as well as increasing the strength of the hydrogen-bonding (a structuring effect) trehalose 
      interferes with the tetrahedral network of water, which can be said to be a <em>destructuring</em> effect [<a  href="ref29.html#r2885" name="r2885" title="go to cited reference" id="r2885">2885</a>]. This destructuring effect   is  distinct from what happens with temperature increases of bulk water  [<a  href="ref32.html#r3155" name="r3155" title="go to cited reference" id="r3155">3155</a>]. It structures out to at least the third solvation layer<sup><a href="#e" name="be" id="be"> e</a></sup> in such a way as 
      to reduce the amount of freezable water [<a href="ref3.html#r285" name="r285" title="go to cited reference" id="r285">285</a>]; <a href="water_methods.html#tera">terahertz spectroscopy</a> indicating 27% more hydration water (&asymp; 190 mols/mol) than lactose and almost four times the hydration water than glucose [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1427">1427</a><a name="r1427" id="r1427"></a>]. 
      This is caused by an increase in the local structuring, 
      partly due to maximizing the number of singly hydrogen-bonded 
      water molecules (to trehalose) where every hydroxyl group of the trehalose molecule is both a single donor and a single acceptor in the hydrogen bond network. In the crystal, there are no (trehalose) intramolecular 
      hydrogen bonds or oriented water molecules held by two (trehalose) 
      hydrogen bonds,  such as in sucrose or cellobiose. There is also a reduced <a title="go to 'Water molecular structure' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html#e">tetrahedrality</a> amongst 
      the associated water molecules [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r660">660</a><a name="r660" id="r660"></a>].    </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Neutron diffraction studies indicate that the hydrogen bonds to water are somewhat shorter (trehalose-O-<b>H&middot;&middot;&middot;O</b>H<sub>2</sub> &asymp; 0.15 nm and trehalose-<b>O&middot;&middot;&middot;H</b>OH &asymp; 0.15 nm) than those between water molecules but with an average of &asymp; 0.9 (trehalose -<b>O&middot;&middot;&middot;H</b>OH) and &asymp; 0.15 (trehalose -O-<b>H&middot;&middot;&middot;O</b>H<sub>2</sub>) hydrogen bonds per hydroxyl group respectively [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1422">1422</a><a name="r1422" id="r1422"></a>]. Virtually  all the water is associated with single hydrogen bonds to trehalose or first  shell water at lower water contents. There is a consequential reduction in the formation of four hydrogen 
      bonds per water molecule compared with bulk water   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3779">3779</a><a name="r3779" id="r3779"></a>].  
      Trehalose is particularly effective at stabilizing macromolecules 
      as it has a large hydrated volume (2.5 times that of sucrose, 
      indicating that there is less water for the same volume; that is, low-density water is present [<a href="ref3.html#r279" name="r279" title="go to cited reference" id="r279">279</a>]). Thus, &alpha;,&alpha;-trehalose reduces bulk water dynamics at low concentrations (0.1  M), with each affecting &asymp; 550 water molecules [<a href="ref28.html#r2779" name="r2779" title="go to cited reference" id="r2779">2779</a>]. Such reduced bulk water dynamics equates to lowered water activity, so stabilizing biomolecules in the solution. This lack of direct effect (i.e., no trehalose-protein interactions) has also been shown by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and viscometry measurements on the myoglobin-trehalose-water system glass transition and protein denaturation temperatures  [<a href="ref28.html#r2780" name="r2780" title="go to cited reference" id="r2780">2780</a>]. The transition from a free aqueous solution to a dense, concentrated glassy state is connected to trehalose's ability to ameliorate an organism's desiccation stress. There  is a strong correlation between the glass transition temperature and  trehalose's hydrogen bonding strength    [<a href="ref41.html#r4065" name="r4065" title="go to cited reference" id="r4065">4065</a>]. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Trehalose can also protect membranes (and whole organisms [<a href="ref15.html#r1426" name="r1426" title="go to cited reference" id="r1426">1426</a>]) in anhydrobiosis by hydrogen 
      bonding directly to the phosphate groups in the phospholipids 
      at low water content, so spreading their head groups and reducing 
      the membrane's tendency to undergo phase transitions and thus 
      leak during rehydration [<a href="ref13.html#r1201" name="r1201" title="go to cited reference" id="r1201">1201</a>]. 
      Thus trehalose exhibits different mechanisms of action with proteins from those with membranes [<a href="ref4.html#r308" name="r308" title="go to cited reference" id="r308">308</a>]. As  further protective action trehalose crystals, formed 
      at low water content, can lose (and regain) up to two  
      water molecules per trehalose molecule, without changing their crystal structure 
    or volume [<a href="ref4.html#r327" name="r327" title="go to cited reference" id="r327">327</a>, <a href="ref15.html#r1486" name="r1486" title="go to cited reference" id="r1486">1486</a>]. </p>

<p align="left">TMAO  balances the destabilization effects of urea that are often also present. This allows organisms, such as deep-sea teleost fish, which contain both TMAO and urea, to maintain their protein structure while adjusting their osmotic pressure. It exemplifies the difficulty in describing molecules as structure-makers or structure-breakers as molecules that can form very strong links to water may weaken water-water links further away; whether experimental evidence finds structure-making or -breaking depends on which of these molecules of water are examined. For example, infrared spectroscopy  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1893">1893</a><a name="r1893" id="r1893"></a>] and concentration-dependent terahertz/far-infrared (THz/FIR) and Raman spectroscopic techniques [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref26.html#r2514">2514</a><a name="r2514" id="r2514"></a>] both show that

However, this counteracting role of TMAO in proteins under denaturing condition of urea is in contrast to its reinforcement of urea denaturation on hydrophobic macromolecules     [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2841">2841</a><a name="r2841" id="r2841"></a>]. TMAO and urea show  significantly different topological behaviors, with TMAO forming more stable extensive networks and urea forming tightly aggregated local clusters      [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3758">3758</a><a name="r3758" id="r3758"></a>].</p>

<p align="left">TMAO also affects membranes.

TMAO does this by being excluded from the lipid interface due to its unfavorable interactions with the lipid head-groups. The change in the osmotic pressure drives the bilayer closure.

<h2><a name="hyal" id="hyal"></a>Hyaluronic acid</h2>
<p align="l">Polymers may also act as chaotropes or kosmotropes. Hyaluronic acid is a high molecular weight hydrophilic, glycosaminoglycan lubricant found in epithelial, neural, and connective&nbsp;tissues where it interacts with the surrounding water making it  thick and viscous. Its properties are significantly dependent on its hydration.</p>
<p align="l">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="l">Hyaluronic acid (see right) consists of a linear chain of repeating acidic dimers and possesses several groups such as amide, alcohol, and carboxylate groups that have different effects on the aqueous environment. Overall it acts as a structure maker ordering the surrounding water molecules and producing a bio-protective function [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref41.html#r4006">4006</a><a name="r4006" id="r4006"></a>], mutually thermally stabilizing both the water structuring and its own structuring. The spatial extent of the hydration shell can reach up to 475 nm, corresponding to a length of 1600 water molecules [<a href="ref43.html#r4217" name="r4217" title="go to cited reference" id="r4217">4217</a>].</p>

<p align="l">The excess presence of chaotropic (e.g., Na<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) ions or kosmotropic (e.g. NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) ions affect the limiting diffusion coefficient of 0.1% sodium hyaluronate. Na<sup>+</sup> ions reduce diffusion, and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> produce less resistance to the movement of sodium hyaluronate and thus cause an increase in its diffusion   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref43.html#r4210">4210</a><a name="r4210" id="r"></a>].</p>

    <p><sup><a name="b" id="b"> b</a></sup> Opposite is shown a cartoon 
      illustrating the main difference between ionic chaotropes 
      and kosmotropes. Water molecules surrounding ionic chaotropes 
      tend towards a convex dodecahedral (clathrate) arrangement. In contrast, those surrounding ionic kosmotropes tend towards 
      a puckered arrangement with several water molecules 
      lying close to the ion (<a href="water_cluster_equilibria.html#pucker" title="go to 'Water cluster equilibria' page">see 
      elsewhere for more details</a>), causing bent and broken 
      hydrogen-bonding further out. The dodecahedral water cluster 
      may be thought of as continually fluctuating (over a period 
      of a few ps or so, see [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref9.html#r895">895</a>]), 
      interconverting between convex and puckered forms with 
      the preferred clustering governed by the chaotropic-kosmotropic 
      balance. The strength of the ion-water links explains why the ionic kosmotropes remain hydrated towards the bulk phase near a lipophilic interface, while the ionic chaotropes lose their hydration sheath [<a href="ref17.html#r1663"  title="go to cited reference">1663</a>] and can adsorb to an oil-water interface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3429">3429</a><a name="r3429" id="r3429"></a>].
