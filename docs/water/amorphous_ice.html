    <h2><a name="meta" id="meta2"></a>Cold metastable glassy water </h2>
    <p>Amorphous ices [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4184">4184</a><a name="r4184" id="r4184"></a>], lacking long-range order with structures more similar to liquid water rather than crystalline ices, are glassy metastable forms of ice. They are kinetically stable in the pressure-temperature stability space of the thermodynamically stable crystalline ices. They can, therefore, exist for short or long periods of time (e.g., diamonds are metastable with respect to graphite at ambient temperatures and pressures). As glasses are out-of-equilibrium systems, their properties depend  on their preparatory history and are not defined by  the state variables (the number of molecules, the system volume, and the temperature) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3726">3726</a><a name="r3726" id="r3726"></a>]. Due to the thermodynamic instablility of the amorphous ices, it is possible to avoid their formation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3606">3606</a><a name="r3606" id="r3606"></a>]; slow compression  of hexagonal ice  at 100 K giving proton-ordered ice IX, then  proton-ordered and interpenetrating ice XV, and finally, ice VIII. If cooled very rapidly, liquid water  forms a glass<sup><a name="be" id="be"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="amorphous_ice.html#e"> e</a></sup> rather than crystallizing to hexagonal ice, for example, hyperquenched glassy water (HGW, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref4.html#r312e">312e</a><a name="r312e" id="r312e"></a>]). HGW forms on  the rapid spraying of a thin jet of &mu;m-sized water droplets into a freezing  liquefied gas (for example, liquid propane), or onto a very cold solid substrate, about or  below 80 K or by cooling capillary tubes containing bulk liquid water (&asymp; 100 &mu;m  diameter) with liquid helium at 4.2 K [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1005">1005</a><a name="r1005" id="r1005"></a>]. These methods all involve cooling  rates of greater than 10<sup>5</sup> K  &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>. The glasses have structural, thermodynamic, and  density similarity with liquid water at 0&nbsp;&deg;C due to their methods of  formation and amorphous properties. A similar material is amorphous solid water  (ASW), formed from the slow deposition of water vapor, at &lt; 2 nm  &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>, onto a  very cold metal crystal surface below 120 K [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r900">900</a><a name="r900" id="r900"></a>]. ASW (also called low-density  glass, 0.94 g &#739; cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> solid) may contain considerable voids (with internal surface area of up to 230 m<sup>2</sup>  &#739; g<sup>&minus;1</sup> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2425">2425</a><a name="r2425" id="r2425"></a>]) and dangling hydrogen bonds, which are  removed by annealing under vacuum at 120-140 K. At this temperature,  the glass converts to material  indistinguishable from HGW or low-density amorphous ice (LDA, 0.94 g   &#739; cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>) at  slightly higher temperatures. High-density glassy water (HDG, 1.1 g   &#739; cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>), formed  by vapor deposition at 10 K [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r692">692</a><a name="r692" id="r692"></a>] and subject to cosmic ray irradiation,<sup><a name="bd" id="bd"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="amorphous_ice.html#d">d</a></sup> may be  the most prevalent form of water in the universe. Notably, this 10-K ice has a higher density than if the vapor is deposited at 77 K due to significantly increased  water molecules held at <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals </a>distances (&asymp; 3.3 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There  is much interest in high-density ice (HDA, 1.17 g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> at  0.1 MPa) and very-high-density ice (VHDA, 1.26 g   &#739; cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> at 0.1 MPa) formed from  LDA or crystalline ices. These last three amorphous ices (LDA, HDA, and VHDA) occupy three distinct megabasins in the energy landscape [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1719">1719</a><a name="r1719" id="r1719"></a>] but are not required to obey the <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html#a">'ice 
      rules'</a> and may contain a significant number of dangling bonds. Their structures may depend on the preparative method and the thermodynamic history, with well-relaxed (annealed) samples showing higher thermal stability  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1953">1953</a><a name="r1953" id="r1953"></a>]. When annealed, they are expected to consist of fully hydrogen-bonded tetrahedral networks. This expectation is supported by their  first-order phase transformation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2968">2968</a><a name="r2968" id="r2968"></a>]. The HDA to LDA transformation  is a macroscopic phase separation rather than a homogeneous mixing of structures on the molecular scale. It is governed by the restructuring of the oxygen network rather than proton re-organization  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2968">2968</a>] but highly dependent on the preparation and any prior relaxation of the LDA [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2992">2992</a><a name="r2992" id="r2992"></a>]. Although some confusing data has been published, HDA and LDA are distinct polyamorphs, with VHDA being less distinct as it may relax toward HDA [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3239">3239</a><a name="r3239" id="r3239"></a>]. HDA reaches the metastable equilibrium with LDA at 140 K and 0.1 GPa [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3239">3239</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Amorphous ices have been  reviewed [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1122">1122</a><a name="r1122" id="r1122"></a>,<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1719"> </a><a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1543">1543</a><a name="r1543" id="r1543"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1719">1719</a>], and their vibrational [<a name="r1202" id="r1202"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1202">1202</a>] and diffraction scattering data compared  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1546">1546</a><a name="r1546" id="r1546"></a>, <a  href="ref36.html#r3501" name="r3501" title="go to cited reference" id="r5">3501</a>]. Their refractive index has been compared to crystalline ice  [<a href="ref43.html#r4215" name="r4215" title="go to cited reference" id="r4215">4215</a>]. Neutron scattering indicates that ASW, LDA, and HGW are structurally very similar [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1546">1546</a>], particularly if annealed. The amorphous ices have similar (unexpected) long-range order (but not short-range or intermediate-range order) and are not merely unstructured as typically frozen liquids  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3227">3227</a><a name="r3227" id="r3227"></a>]. The HDA <img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" /> LDA phase transition has been examined [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1635">1635</a><a name="r1635" id="r3"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1682">1682</a><a name="r1682" id="r1682"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Solid water can thus  exist in several non-crystalline forms (glasses), which have specific  physical characteristics such as density and vibrational spectra. Although  often treated as though they are homogeneous, there is no support for this  assumption. Many natural glasses are heterogeneous on the nano- or  micro- scale with two or more separate phases [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r993">993</a><a name="r993" id="r993"></a>]. As amorphous materials, they mostly behave as glasses, which act as liquid depending on the time scale of observation. Many, but not all of the  transformations, are shown below (mainly from [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r569">569</a>]). All the amorphous solids  are recovered to ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) at 77 K (liquid nitrogen) where  they are (meta)stable for extended periods. While different preparations of the  same density may have similar properties, materials prepared  by very different routes may differ. Some may be mechanically collapsed  ice, whereas others may have structures related to liquid water   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1682">1682</a>], with  transformations between these forms on annealing being possible but not  obligatory. Using D<sub>2</sub>O below &sim;210 K, but under confined conditions under pressure preventing freezing, two regions are found; a 'low-density liquid' phase and a 'high-density liquid' phase 16% more dense [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref22.html#r2181">2181</a><a name="r2181" id="r2181"></a>]. There is no evidence that any of these amorphous ices are   microcrystalline, although sometimes they have  been proposed. There are comprehensive reviews of the amorphous phases of ice and their  transitions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r569">569</a><a name="r569" id="r569"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2033">2033</a><a name="r2033" id="r2033"></a>], a noteworthy simulation study of this polymorphism  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r590">590</a><a name="r590" id="r590"></a>],  and a  critical review of the experimental data, particularly the diffraction data [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1544">1544</a><a name="r1544" id="r2"></a>]. Similarities to other tetrahedrally arranged substances (e.g., silicon and germanium) have also been noted  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2392">2392</a><a name="r2392" id="r2392"></a>]. </p>

A highly viscous, deeply  supercooled liquid water phase ('<a href="cluster_evidence.html#a">extremely strong</a>') can be formed from either solid LDA, HDA, and VHDA, indicating an extension of 'normal' supercooled  liquid water with structural similarities. The transformation occurs on warming amorphous LDA, or compact amorphous solid water (ASW) deposited at 77 K [<a  href="ref26.html#r2593" name="r2593" title="go to cited reference" id="r2593">2593</a>], to about 136 K [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r74">74</a><a name="r74" id="r74"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r137">137</a><a name="r137" id="r137"></a>] or heating solid HDA at 1 GPa from approximately 130 K [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1770">1770</a><a name="r1770" id="r1770"></a>].  On further slow heating above 136 K, the liquid material from compact ASW crystallizes at 144 K [<a  href="ref26.html#r2593" title="go to cited reference" >2593</a>]. There is a highly significant slow down in water's molecular dynamics on approach to the glass transition temperature (&asymp; 136 K, see below). Additionally, there is a coupling  of the thermodynamic and dynamical behavior [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3182">3182</a><a name="r3182" id="r3182"></a>].</p>

    <p>The transformation of HDA is reversible with the low-temperature high-density liquid water phase vitrifying on subsequent cooling [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1770">1770</a>]. The use of X-ray photon-correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) in the small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) geometry has indicated that  a first-order liquid-liquid transition between low-density liquid and high-density liquid, occurs within the ultra-viscous regime [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2930">2930</a><a name="r2930" id="r2930"></a>]. X-ray diffraction has shown that the transformations of the ultra-viscous liquid phases of LDA and HDA occur at about 140 K and 0.2 GPa [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1762">1762</a><a name="r1762" id="r1762"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ultra-viscous liquid HDA can exist down to 116 K under ambient pressure  [<a  href="ref21.html#r2048" name="r2048" title="go to cited reference" id="r2048">2048</a>, <a  href="ref36.html#r3598" name="r3598" title="go to cited reference" id="r3598">3598</a>]. A single sample of annealed HDA at 80 K can be warmed through 116 K to produce a high-density ultra-viscous liquid that can be allowed to convert to a low-density ultra-viscous liquid at 136 K and then to LDA if brought down below 136 K. The two distinct ultra-viscous states of water differ by about 25% in density [<a  href="ref21.html#r2048" title="go to cited reference" >2048</a>]. If  ice-VIII is subjected to a rapid decompression (&sim;48 GPa/s) between 140 K and 165 K, it transforms to a low-density  liquid.

    <p>The variation of density with temperature and pressure has been investigated using an Equation of State model, [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3954">3954</a>] (see left). Data from such a model can reveal what happens below the limit of homogeneous nucleation (i.e., the 'no-mans land' where liquid water cannot exist). The figure also shows the liquid-liquid transition line where metastable ultraviscous waters are preferred over ordinary liquid water (although both cannot be reached experimentally at these temperatures). The liquid-liquid critical point (C.Pt.) is at 220.9 K, 60 M<a href="constants.html#Pa" title="pascal">Pa</a> in this system.</p>

The very existence of  deeply supercooled  liquid water, between about 136-160 K, is evidence that the glass transition  temperature  is the <a title="go to 'Water properties data' page"  href="water_properties.html">lower 
      of those proposed</a> (136 K, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref4.html#r312">312</a>]), although characterized by only a small change in specific heat due to the high degree of strong hydrogen-bonding in the liquid.

	  <p>Vitrified water droplets, formed through rapid cooling (&#8805; 10<sup>6</sup>    K &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>) to 80 K, followed, or not, by pressurization (0.2 GPa), were shown to be thermodynamically continuously connected with distinct low- and high-density liquids rather than crystalline ices.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Deeply  supercooled liquid water forms when amorphous ices are 'annealed' at  temperatures just above 136 K. This lower density, deeply supercooled liquid water is an excellent solvent for inert gas (e.g., xenon) atoms but is reported to be a very poor solvent for salt (LiCl) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1120">1120</a><a name="r1120" id="r1120"></a>] (however see<a href="amorphous_ice.html#licl"> below</a> for the different behavior of the high density deeply supercooled liquid water). In addition, it has an excess entropy (1-2 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>  &#739; K<sup>&minus;1</sup>) much smaller than the entropy difference between liquid water and crystalline ice at 0&nbsp;&deg;C (22 mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>   &#739; K<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and an enthalpy of crystallization at 150 K (&sim;1.35 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>) also much smaller than the heat of crystallization of liquid water (&sim;6 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>) both indicating a high degree of tetrahedral order via intermolecular hydrogen-bonding [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1840">1840</a>]. These properties indicate <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>-like qualities, with a possible molecular explanation presented <a href="strand.html#Fig5">elsewhere</a>. At higher temperatures (&asymp; 165 K) LiCl becomes very soluble. At high concentrations, it forms a deeply supercooled solution, as its interactions with ultra-viscous water overcome the strong water-water interactions present at lower temperatures [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1225">1225</a><a name="r1225" id="r1225"></a>]. </p>

    <p><a name="licl" id="licl"></a>Further support for the presence of  low-density ultraviscous liquid (LDL) and high-density ultraviscous liquid (HDL) has come from the study of dilute LiCl solutions in high-density ultraviscous liquid  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3202">3202</a>]. Both liquids give sharp transitions to glass  in dilute LiCl aqueous solutions above 0.01-mole fraction, in contrast to pure water. Deeply undercooled LiCl:6D<sub>2</sub>O water solution has been investigated  as a function of pressure by neutron diffraction, small-angle neutron scattering, and molecular dynamics simulations  [<a href="ref39.html#r3836" name="r3836" title="go to cited reference" id="r3836">3836</a>].

The results show a high-temperature dependence near the liquid-liquid critical  point resulting from a rapid conversion from high-density liquid-like  environments with faster dynamics to low-density liquid-like ones with slower  dynamics. </p>

    <p>The use of an ionic liquid hydrazinium trifluoroacetate (N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>TFA) solution that interfered little in the apparent structure of water has achieved even more impressive supporting data [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref36.html#r3571">3571</a><a name="r3571" id="r3571"></a>]. Using molecular dynamics, the contrast in structures between HDL and LDL is shown as NaCl partitions into the HDL and Ne partitions into the LDL fraction of supercooled water at temperatures below the second critical point [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref37.html#r3623">3623</a><a name="r3623" id="r3623"></a>]; HDL thus showing a broken hydrogen-bonded structure and LDL showing an open clathrate-like structure. Several other materials possess a liquid-liquid transition, such as phosphorus and silicon [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref27.html#r2602">2602</a><a name="r2602" id="r6"></a>]. There is further support from studies involving doping and isotope substitution  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref36.html#r3532">3532</a><a name="r3532" id="r3532"></a>]. Using infrared spectroscopy and calorimetry, this solution is shown to undergo a sharp, reversible phase transition (&asymp; 190 K) between two homogeneous liquid states similar to those established for high-density and low-density amorphous (HDA and LDA) water. Although this is not 'pure' water, it strongly supports the two-state hypothesis in pure water at higher temperatures.</p>

In particular, LDA-I is obtained by isobaric warming of HDA at ambient pressure and LDA-II is obtained by isothermal decompression of VHDA at 143 K. LDA is stable for months at 77 K and ambient pressure but transforms  into cubic ice (probably <a href="ice1h1c.html">stacking disordered ice</a>) at about 150-160 K.

    <h2><a name="hda" id="hda"></a>High-density amorphous ice (HDA)</h2>
    <p>HDA was first described in 1984 [<a href="ref.html#r34" name="r34" title="go to cited reference" id="r34">34</a>]. HDA  includes  the more thermally-stable expanded high-density amorphous ice (eHDA, made by decompressing <a href="amorphous_ice.html#vhda">VHDA</a>, causing thermal relaxation, at 140 K) and unannealed high-density amorphous ice (uHDA) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1719">1719</a>]. uHDA is prepared by submitting low-pressure ices (<span class="style1"><a title="go to find more on structure" href="hexagonal_ice.html">I</a></span><a title="go to find more on structure" href="hexagonal_ice.html">h</a>, <span class="style1"><a title="go to find more on structure" href="cubic_ice.html">I</a></span><a title="go to find more on structure" href="cubic_ice.html">c</a>, <a title="go to find more on structure" href="ice_xi.html"><span class="style1">XI</span></a><sup><a name="ba" id="ba"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="amorphous_ice.html#a"> a</a></sup> or LDA) to high pressure (&asymp; 1.5 GPa, ice Ih; 
      &asymp; 0.5 GPa, LDA) at low temperatures (for example, at 80 K [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2071">2071</a>] to 125 K [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1122">1122</a>]). HDA may be made on releasing the pressure on <a href="ice_vii.html">ice VII</a>; this is then followed by the  HDA&ndash;LDA transition, followed by the crystallization of LDA into cubic and hexagonal ice  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4156">4156</a><a name="r4156" id="r4156"></a>]. Typical of glasses and as with LDA, some preparations of HDA differ from  others depending on the preparative methodology. Unannealed and expanded HDA ices have been compared using isotope substitution neutron diffraction [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3730">3730</a><a name="r3730" id="r3730"></a>]. It is stable for months at 
      77 K and ambient pressure. HDA has a density of 1.17 g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> at 0.1 MPa (1.31 g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> at 1.0 GPa; HDA of D<sub>2</sub>O 
      has a density of 1.30 g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> at 0.1 MPa). The structural evolution on going from high-density amorphous ices  to the low-density state has been described [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r3577">3577</a><a name="r3577" id="r3577"></a>]. HDA, when found in cryogenic electron microscopy,  is locally heated above its glass-transition temperature and subject to electron beam-induced transformation to LDA. This transformation may be assisted by a pseudo-Brownian motion of water molecules due to bond reorientation induced by the electron beam [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4154">4154</a><a name="r4154" id="r4154"></a>]. The cryopreservation of biomolecules is better if using HDA rather than LDA, with recovery using isochoric heating (a constant volume process) as the recovery process, as opposed to isobaric heating (a constant pressure process)  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r4323">4323</a><a name="r4323" id="r4323"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The uHDA structure is unknown and varies between preparations and probably consists of a mixture of constrained frozen materials, whereas the eHDA is glassy. The material appears 
      to be heterogeneous on a length scale of nanometers [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref10.html#r995">995</a><a name="r995" id="r995"></a>]. It has been suggested that HDA forms due to the formation of the kinetically arrested transformation, on pressurization, between <a href="hexagonal_ice.html">hexagonal ice</a> and high-density <a href="ice_xv.html">ice XV </a> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3606">3606</a>]. However, the available data is not inconsistent with HDA (made from LDA) having the structure of crushed <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page" href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>;

<p>Once a clathrate cage has puckered, there exists a more significant potential 
      energy barrier to changes in puckering (for example, from 
      a <a href="water_cluster_equilibria.html">tetrahedral to an octahedral arrangement</a>). 
      Therefore as the initial puckering is expected to vary from 
      site to site depending on the strength (and weakness) of surrounding 
      hydrogen-bonding, HDA formed this way is expected to be somewhat 
      disordered. <a name="ida" id="ida"></a>As

    <h2><a name="vhda" id="vhda"></a>Very-high-density amorphous ice (VHDA)</h2>
    <p>VHDA (first recognized in 2001 [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r693">693</a><a name="r693" id="r693"></a>]) 
      is prepared by submitting high-density amorphous ice (HDA) 
      at 77 K to isobaric heating to 160 K at 1.15 GPa [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r421">421</a><a name="r421" id="r421"></a>]. 
      On isobaric annealing of HDA between 0.3 and 1.9 GPa (with 
      temperature increasing from 77 K), VHDA appears to have formed 
      at 0.8 GPa with changes in density at higher pressures being 
      due to elastic compression [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r935">935</a><a name="r935" id="r935"></a>]. The higher the annealing pressure  and temperature of VHDA, the higher the thermal stability against crystallization. Thus, this shows that the better-annealed material has fewer microcrystals within its structure    [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3253">3253</a><a name="r93253" id="r3253"></a>].

Indeed, the phase transition from high-density amorphous ice (HDA) to very-high-density amorphous ice (VHDA) seems to be continuous rather than sudden (first-order) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2665">2665</a><a name="r2665" id="r2665"></a>], at least at positive pressures   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref29.html#r2895">2895</a>]. D<sub>2</sub>O behaves similarly to H<sub>2</sub>O, but with crystallization, to a mixture of  high-pressure ices, taking place above 143 K rather than 140 K  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1534">1534</a><a name="r1534" id="r1534"></a>].

As VHDA is formed from HDA by  structural relaxation (also known as <abbr title="relaxed high density ice">rHDA</abbr>),

Moreover, it appears to have a lower chemical potential than HDA for the entire range of pressures   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref29.html#r2895">2895</a>].

  <p>The LDA-VHDA transformation has been studied using x-ray diffraction under isothermal compression and decompression. It was found to occur in two steps: a discontinuous transition between LDA and an HDA followed by a continuous change within this HDA involving structural reconfigurations and finally converging to VHDA [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3774">3774</a><a name="r3774" id="r3774"></a>].</p>

      contrast to HDA which can form ice IX [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r932">932</a><a name="r932" id="r932"></a>]). 
      Molecular dynamics simulations in 2005 indicated that HDA might 
      evolve continuously into VHDA. Densification caused an 
      increase in hydrogen-bonded rings containing 8-10 water molecules 
      due to more efficient packing [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r747">747</a>], 
      like <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_xii.html">ice-twelve</a> with its 7- and 
      8- membered rings and similar density. If higher pressure 
      is used (2 - 4 GPa) on HDA, then high-pressure ices (<a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_vii.html">ice-seven</a> or <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_viii.html">ice-eight</a>) are formed.  
      VHDA shows structural similarities to high-pressure cold  
      (&gt;0.2 GPa, &lt; 273 K; cooled and supercooled high-density 
      liquid water) and hot water   
      (to 6.5 GPa and 670 K [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1001">1001</a><a name="r1001" id="r1001"></a>]) but possesses more extensive ordering. Thus, there is the possibility of a phase transition line 
      between supercooled metastable liquid forms of LDA (called 
      low-density liquid, LDL) and VHDA (called high-density liquid, 
      HDL, and often referred to as the liquid phase of HDA before 
      the discovery of VHDA). Such a situation 
      is expected to end in a <a title="go to 'Water properties data' page"  href="water_properties.html#secondcriticalpoint">second

      many of the low-temperature anomalies of liquid water. On the approach to the critical pressure and temperature,  the ratio between thermal expansivity and specific heat (related to the Gr&uuml;neisen parameter, &Gamma;)

    <p><sup><a name="e" id="e"></a>e</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Glass.</strong> A glass is a nonequilibrium state of matter between that of a solid and a liquid. It is a non-crystalline amorphous solid that has a  nanoscopically and microscopically disordered structure  but many of the mechanical properties of a solid. Zanotto and Mauro have defined a glass as &ldquo;<em>Glass is a nonequilibrium, non-crystalline state of matter that appears solid on a short time scale but continuously relaxes towards the liquid state </em> &rdquo;, with a more advanced definition given as  &quot;<em>Glass is a nonequilibrium, non-crystalline   condensed state of matter that exhibits a glass transition. The   structure of glasses is similar to that of their parent supercooled   liquids, and they spontaneously relax toward the supercooled   liquid state. Their ultimate fate, in the limit of infinite time, is to crystallize</em>&quot; [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3052">3052a</a><a name="r3052" id="r3052"></a>]. <a name="glassy" id="glassy"></a>In the <strong>glassy 
      state,</strong> the viscosity is exceptionally high (&gt; 10<sup>12</sup>-10<sup>13</sup> Pa<abbr title="International system of units">   &#739; </abbr> s), conformational changes are severely inhibited, and 
      the material is metastably trapped in a solid but microscopically 
      disordered state. A glass is rigid and brittle. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> The <strong>glass 
      transition temperature</strong> (T<sub>g</sub>) is the temperature at which the molecular relaxation time reaches 100 s, and the viscosity of the system becomes 10<sup>12</sup> Pa <abbr title="International system of units">   &#739; </abbr>s.   The relaxation time (&tau;,  the return of the perturbed system back to equilibrium) of the material can distinguish between  a glassy state (&tau; &#x226b;1000 s) and a liquid (&tau; &#x226a;1000 s); with glasses and liquids being isotropic and solids being anisotropic [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3052">3052b</a>]. The flow rate of glassy water is about 10<sup>&minus;14</sup> m &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup> (&asymp; 30 &micro;m in a century) compared with liquid water &asymp; 4 m &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>. The glass 
      transition is a time-temperature kinetic transition rather than a thermodynamic transition, and different methods of cooling produce slightly different glass transition temperatures. Usually, there are discontinuities in the physical, mechanical, electrical, thermal, and other material properties. Therefore, the
      value of T<sub>g</sub> depends somewhat on the method 
      of its determination; the glass transition (unlike actual thermodynamic phase 
      changes) occurring over a range of a few Kelvin. [<a title="click for an explanation" href="amorphous_ice.html#be"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>] </p>
