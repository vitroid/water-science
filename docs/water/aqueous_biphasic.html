	<h2>Introduction to aqueous biphasic systems
    </h2>
    <h2>
    <p align="left">Although often not recognized, there are many aqueous biphasic systems in nature. Many intracellular liquid compartments form by phase separation from the cytoplasm   [<a href="ref31.html#r3084">3084</a><a name="r3084" id="r3084"></a>] and the nucleus. These compartments do not have membranes. An example is the nucleolus,  the  ribosome production site inside the nucleus containing  many proteins and ribonucleic acids. It has been suggested that the selective partitioning of  therapeutics within compartments  contributes to drug pharmacodynamics and that altering the properties of the aqueous biphasic systems  affects the concentration and activity of drugs   [<a href="ref41.html#r4023">4023</a><a name="r4023" id="r4023"></a>]. Different  water clustering coexists within a mixture of  phase-forming polymers until  polymer concentrations exceed thresholds when the domains become immiscible leading to phase separation [<a href="ref39.html#r3872" name="r3872" title="go to cited reference" id="r3872">3872</a>]. The  hydrogen bonding in the separate phases is an important factor in phase separation    [<a href="ref44.html#r4391">4391</a><a name="r4391" id="r4391"></a>] and correlates with  their hydrophobic and electrostatic properties.    </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The addition of salts to water will segregate into their preferred <a href="cluster_evidence.html#2phas">water structuring </a>[<a  href="ref20.html#r1994" name="r1994" title="go to cited reference" id="r1994">1994</a>]. Aqueous biphasic systems occur when specific solutes cause an aqueous solution to separate into two aqueous phases. Beijerinck first noted, in 1896, the 'incompatibility' of certain 
      polymers in aqueous solution. In this case, two phases  
      form when <a href="agar.html">agar</a> is mixed with 
      soluble <a href="starch.html">starch</a> or <a href="gelatin.html">gelatin</a>. 
      Since then, many immiscible biphasic aqueous systems have 
      been found utilizing hydrophilic polymers in aqueous solution; 
      for example, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, HO-(CH<sub>2</sub>-CH<sub>2</sub>-O)<sub>n</sub>-H 
      where n is the degree of polymerization)<sup><a name="bc" id="bc"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="aqueous_biphasic.html#c"> c</a></sup>. Different  polymers often do not mix well. The entropy of a mixture of extended polymers is lowered by a factor roughly equal to the average degree of polymerization compared with a mixture of the monomers. Mixing may be sufficient to cause the separation into homogeneous phase regions, each containing a different polymer. The most thoroughly 
      investigated  is the aqueous dextran-<abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> system, where dextran forms the more hydrophilic, denser, 
      lower phase, and <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> the more hydrophobic, less dense, upper phase. Extensive examinations 
      of <em>in vitro</em> [<a  href="ref2.html#r171" name="r171" title="go to cited reference" id="r171">171</a>] 
      and <em>in vivo</em> [<a  href="ref3.html#r264" name="r264" title="go to cited reference" id="r264">264</a>] 
      aqueous phase separations are available, including the separation of metal ions [<a  href="ref35.html#r3499" name="r3499" title="go to cited reference" id="r3499">3499</a>].&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>Phases form when limiting concentrations of the polymers 
      are exceeded. Both phases contain mainly water (typically 
      70-90% w/w water) and are enriched in diofferent polymers. 
      The limiting concentrations depend on the type and molecular 
      weight of the polymers and  the pH, <a href="water_dissociation.html#o">ionic strength</a> and temperature 
      of the solution. Some polymers form a two-phase system by 
      themselves; <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> forming the upper more-hydrophobic phase in the presence of 
      fairly concentrated solutions of citrates, phosphates, or sulfates 
      or at higher temperatures (see <a title="click for an explanation" href="aqueous_biphasic.html#cloud">below</a>).&nbsp;Such 
      aqueous liquid-liquid two-phase systems are finding increasing 
      use in the extractive separation of labile biomolecules such 
      as proteins. <sup><a name="bd" id="bd"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="aqueous_biphasic.html#d"> d</a></sup> They offer mild conditions due to the low interfacial 
      tension between the phases (that is, about 400-fold less 
      than that between water and an immiscible organic solvent), 
      allowing small droplet size, large interfacial areas, efficient 
      mixing under very gentle stirring, and rapid partition. The 
      polymers also have a stabilizing influence on most proteins. 
      A great variety of separations have been achieved, by far 
      the most important being the separation of enzymes from broken 
      crude cell material. Separation may be accomplished in a few minutes, 
      minimizing the harmful action of endogenous proteases. The 
      systems have also been used successfully to separatie different types of cell membranes, organelles, and actinide 
      ions, the purification of enzymes, extractive bioconversions. 
      Although sometimes perceived as due to polymer incompatibilities, 
      the properties of these biphasic systems are mainly attributed 
      to the mismatch between aqueous pools of lower and higher 
      density water. Each phase may be considered  a different, 
      although aqueous, solvent with properties determined by its 
      structuring (see, for example, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r171">171</a>]).</p>

If a solution is made 0.14 m <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr>-2000 and 0.6 m K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (point <strong>B</strong>), it is outside the one-phase area and splits into two phases (<strong>A</strong> and <strong>C</strong>) with different compositions (<strong>A</strong> = 0.29 m <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr>-2000, 0.23 m K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; <strong>C</strong> = 0.03 m <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr>-2000, 0.9 m K<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, in the example ). The phase volumes are such that the masses of solutes balance; thus, the mass of <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> in <strong>A</strong> plus the mass of <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> in <strong>C</strong> must equal the mass of <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> in <strong>B</strong>.

    <p>Deep eutectic solvents <sup><a name="be" id="be"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="aqueous_biphasic.html#e"> e</a></sup> have been proposed as phase-forming compounds of aqueous biphasic systems   [<a href="ref38.html#r3795" name="r3795" title="go to cited reference" id="r3795">3795</a>], resulting from the interaction of a hydrogen-bond acceptor  and a hydrogen-bond donor.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="aqueous_biphasic.html#e"> e</a></sup> The ability of the hydrogen-bond donors may be correlated with the  logarithm of their octanol-water partition coefficients (<a href="pure_water.html#phobic">log<b><i>P</i></b></a>),  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3077">3077</a><a name="r3077" id="r3077"></a>]. For example, the log<b><i>P</i></b>s of glucose, glycerol, ethylene glycol, ethanol, and <em>n</em>-propanol are -2.93, -1.84, -1.21 -0.16, and +0.36, respectively, with decreasing hydrophilicity with increasing log<b><i>P</i></b>. The most hydrophobic hydrogen-bond donors tend to form organic-aqueous two-phase systems.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The distribution of organic solutes between the aqueous phases is a function only of the difference in the polymer concentration between the phases and depends little or not at all on the salt used [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref27.html#r2667">2667</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style=" float:none; clear:both;"></div>

 
    <p><abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> [<a href="ref33.html#r3297" name="r3297" title="go to cited reference" id="r3297">3297</a>] usually 
      has a far higher concentration in the upper (low-density) 
      phase of such solutions despite  its inherent density being 
      higher than water. This concentration, together with the properties of 
      this <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> phase, encourages the belief that it creates a predominantly <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#LDW">low-density water</a> environment 
      due to its partially <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">hydrophobic character</a>, 
      in turn mainly determined by the methylene groups. Further 
      proof of this may be seen using microwave dielectric measurements, 
      which show the water surrounding <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> to be ordered, whereas that surrounding more hydrophilic polymers 
      is disordered [<a  href="ref4.html#r338" name="r338" title="go to cited reference" id="r338">338</a>]. 
      Also, the dissolution of PEG is exothermic (and increasingly 
      exothermic with PEG size), in line with a shift in the <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#Fig2"><img border="0" src="images/rarrow.gif" width="20" height="12"  alt="reversible arrow" /></a><abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#Fig2"> equilibrium</a> towards the more ordered <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> structure. It is interesting and perhaps not merely fortuitous 
      that the diameter (4.9 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>) of the favored <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> helix (formed by trans, gauche, trans links across the C-O-C-C,

    <p>Model building shows that optimum hydrogen bonding would tend 
      to distort this PEG helix, however. As determined by viscosity, the strongly-held hydration increases from two molecules of 
      water per PEG monomer at very low polymerization (tetramer) 
      to 5 molecules of water per PEG monomer for 45-mer [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r576">576</a>a<a name="r576" id="r576"></a>],<sup><a name="bb" id="bb"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="aqueous_biphasic.html#b"> b</a></sup> showing that the extent of water clustering increases with 
      PEG size. The total number of water molecules associated with each PEG monomer is about 32  
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref20.html#r1958">1958</a><a name="r1958" id="r1958"></a>], or out to about 2-3 nm radius. The partitioning of proteins into the hydrophobic 
      PEG phase shows strong sensitivity to the protein's surface 
      hydrophobicity (partition increasing with surface hydrophobicity) 
      and  depends on the PEG size; increasing with PEG molecular 
      mass [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r597">597</a><a name="r597" id="r597"></a>], 
      in line with the extent of water clustering. Increasing PEG 
      size and concentration both raise the proteins' effective 
      hydration as the PEG is excluded from the proteins' surface 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r953">953</a><a name="r953" id="r953"></a>]. 
      However, when the PEG phase becomes too ordered (for example, at higher PEG size), partitioned proteins are excluded [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r598">598</a><a name="r598" id="r598"></a>] 
      due to the reduced available water content.</p>

    <p><a name="cloud" id="cloud"></a>An interesting and revealing phenomenon 
      occurs in <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> solutions as the temperature is raised. The solution at low 
      temperatures separates into two phases (<abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr>-rich 
      and <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr>-poor). 
      At higher temperatures, it separates at the cloud-point (where the liquid phase turns cloudy) and 
      at even higher temperatures it reverts to a clear single phase. This phenomenon is shown schematically opposite  and  
      may be explained as the <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> creating a <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#LDW">low-density water</a> environment with decreased entropy [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r451">451</a><a name="r451" id="r451"></a>]. 
      At low temperatures, a solution is formed due to the enthalpy 
      of hydrogen-bonding between the <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> and the water more than compensating for the entropy lost 
      in forming the low-density water. This entropy loss is required 
      due to the hydrophobicity of the methylene groups but is 
      not as great as the water is somewhat ordered already at lower 
      temperatures.
      
       The entropy cost is greater 
      at the cloud point as the water is no longer naturally as structured, and two 
      phases develop; probably involving extended chains in the one continuous phase and aggregated chains in the other cloudy phase [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1085">1085</a><a name="r1085" id="r1085"></a>]. With the reduction of water-water interactions at much higher polymer concentrations,  the two-phase area may close up, with the solution returning to a single-phase solution  [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3388">3388</a><a name="r3388" id="r3388"></a>]. It has been shown that there is an opposite concentration dependence of the less polar <em>trans</em> and more polar <em>gauche</em> conformations of both the C&ndash;C and C&ndash;O bonds at low and at high water content, respectively [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref37.html#r3646">3646</a><a name="r3646" id="r3646"></a>]. The stability diagram is more complex in  solutions  containing colloids, such as proteins, where gels form at low temperatures arresting phase separation [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref37.html#r3665">3665</a><a name="r3665" id="r3665"></a>]. </p>

    <p>An aqueous biphasic solution may be prepared using  hydrazinium trifluoroacetate, which has a water molar fraction, x<sub>w</sub>, of 0.84 at ambient pressure [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4337">4337</a><a name="r4337" id="r4337"></a>]. The supercooled ionic solution undergoes a  sharp, reversible liquid-liquid phase transition at ambient pressure, similar  to pure water at lower temperatures and higher pressures.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The stronger hydrogen bonding in D<sub>2</sub>O, 
      relative to H<sub>2</sub>O, is expected to raise the cloud point. 
      At higher temperatures still, the water possesses excess energy 
      and cannot be structured by the <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr>. 
      This reduces the entropic cost, so allowing a solution to 
      form once more.
      When small <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> molecules are used, for example,                  in <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol) 400 g/mol">PEG400</abbr> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1131">1131</a><a name="r1131" id="r1131"></a>], the <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> may aggregate rather than create a second aqueous phase, but the behavior otherwise is similar.
      Other work, however, indicates that water competes successfully for hydrogen-bonding to ethylene glycol compared with ethylene glycol to other ethylene glycol molecules [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1244">1244</a><a name="r1244" id="r1244"></a>], so the situation may be finely balanced and depend on temperature, concentration, and molecular size. This phenomenon has been used  in <a href="water_desalination.html#rev">reverse osmosis</a> where nonionic glycol polymers are used as the osmotically-active draw agent and regenerated by use of the cloud point [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref22.html#r2106">2106</a><a name="r2106" id="r2106"></a>]. </p>

    <p>Low relative molecular mass (molecular weight) soluble materials may form large clusters in an aqueous solution without being  biphasic. Thus, highly concentrated solutions of glucose form smaller (&asymp; 10 nm) and larger (&asymp; 100 nm) scale inhomogeneities. These clusters contain large amounts of water but are distinct from the rest of the solution having a glucose concentration six-times higher [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2165">2165</a><a name="r2165" id="r2165"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Anions have a distinct effect on the cloud point in line 
      with the <a title="go to find more on ionic effects" href="hofmeister_series.html">Hofmeister Series</a> (cloud 
      point lowering: SCN<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; I<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; Br<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; F<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; OH<sup>&minus;</sup> &lt; SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> &lt; HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2- </sup>&lt; CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> &lt; PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&minus;</sup>); 
      the greater lowering of the cloud point is in line with greater 
      surface charge density [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r752">752</a><a name="r752" id="r752"></a>], 
      stronger hydration, greater tendency to avoid low-density 
      water, and the greater destruction of the natural structuring 
      of the water. An oppositely-ordered compensating effect on 
      the cloud point has been recognized due to the binding of the 
      anions to the polymer surface [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r896">896</a><a name="r896" id="r896"></a>]. 
      This tends to raise the cloud point at lower salt concentrations 
      as the bound salt increases the polymer net charge and, hence, 
      solubility. The relative effect of the ions is the reverse 
      of the Hofmeister series just given with weakly hydrated ions 
      binding best, i.e., SCN<sup>&minus;</sup> having the most significant 
      effect and ionic kosmotropes below Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> having a negligible 
      effect. The Hofmeister effects on poly(propylene oxide) phase separation process have been described by a balance between those  interactions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref20.html#r1922">1922</a><a name="r1922" id="r1922"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Cations have a lesser but opposite effect to anions with <a href="kosmotropes_chaotropes.html" title="more on kosmotropes and chaotropes">chaotropes</a> (for example, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) 
      tending to lower the cloud point, but <a href="kosmotropes_chaotropes.html" title="more on kosmotropes and chaotropes">kosmotropes</a> (for example, Li<sup>+</sup>) raising it. Exceptionally, 
      however, some di- and trivalent cations such as Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> act counter to their normal Hofmeister 
      behavior, due presumably to their specific chelation to oxygen 
      atoms in the PEG molecules [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r752">752</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Anions and cations distribute themselves differently between 
      the phases depending on their affinity for low or higher density 
      water but with the requirements that the phases be electrically 
      neutral and iso-osmotic,  producing an interfacial potential 
      difference, which may aid the partitioning of charged biomolecules. 
      Thus, sulfate and phosphate ions prefer the bottom phase. Consequently,, negatively charged proteins are partitioned 
      into the upper <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr> phase,  allowing more sulfate or phosphate ions to partition 
      into their preferred lower phase. Preference for the <abbr title="poly(ethylene glycol)">PEG</abbr>-rich

    <h2><a name="ionic" id="ionic"></a>Ionic liquids    </h2>
    <p> Ionic  liquids are salts that form liquids at low  temperatures [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4340">4340</a><a name="r4340" id="r4340"></a>]. They have large ions with low surface charge density that form short-lived  ion pairs and have difficulty crystallizing. Examples are ethyl ammonium nitrate (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)NH<sub>3<sup>+</sup></sub>&middot;NO<sub>3<sup>&minus; </sup></sub>(m.pt.&nbsp;12&nbsp;&deg;C) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (m.pt.&nbsp;-80&nbsp;&deg;C). Some ionic liquids decompose n distillation (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium nitrate decomposing to give flammable gases) while others distill below 300&nbsp;&deg;C as ion pairs to reform the liquid phase (1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium, bis{(trifluoromethyl)-sulphonyl}amide). Water is often present in ionic liquids,  absorbing from the atmosphere. The effect this water has on the ionic liquids has been investigated; with the water's librational and rotational dynamics increasing with increasing concentration, while the translational dynamics slow down [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4341">4341</a><a name="r4341" id="r4341"></a>]. Ionic liquids have proven to be an alternative to polymers in the formation of aqueous biphasic systems. The addition of common aqueous salt solutions induces ionic-liquid-based aqueous biphasic systems, with the <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#salt">salting-out</a> ability of the anions and cations following their <a title="go to find more on ionic effects" href="hofmeister_series.html">Hofmeister

    <h2><a name="interface" id="assoc2"></a>Aqueous biphasic interfaces</h2>
    <p>The interfaces between two aqueous phases form an exceptional case of

Whereas the water makes up most of both phases and is continuous across the interface, the composition and concentration of the solutes vary substantially across the interface. Additionally, an electric potential may arise between the two solutions (Donnan potential). Calculations indicate excess water at the interface, over a distance of &asymp; 20 nm, with resultant lower interfacial tension (0.01 - 1.0 &mu;<a href="constants.html#N">N</a> &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>) [<a href="ref23.html#r2226" name="r2226" title="go to cited reference" id="r2226">2226</a>]. Any charge difference across the interface, and consequential osmotic pressure, must be more than compensated by the incompatibility of the two phases [<a  href="ref23.html#r2226" title="go to cited reference" >2226</a>]. Polyelectrolytes can strongly adsorb at the interface and stabilize aqueous biphasic systems, including water-in-water emulsions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2788">2788</a><a name="r2788" id="r2788"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Aqueous biphasic phase separation of biopolymers is the driving force for assembling membrane-less biomolecular condensates, such as the membrane-less protein granules (keratohyalin granules) within the terminally differentiating cell layers of mammalian epidermis  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3916">3916</a><a name="r3916" id="r3915"></a>].</p>
    <h2><a name="assoc" id="assoc"></a>Associative phase separation</h2>
    <p>A different form of the aqueous biphasic system is formed by associating molecules.  Such a biphasic system occurs where a water-soluble molecule self-associates but remains soluble, thus creating a soluble polymeric mass that behaves as a distinct aqueous phase [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1696">1696</a><a name="r1696" id="r1696"></a>]. This  happens in some protein-rich areas within cells.</p>

      either one (-O-C-O-C-O-) or three (-O-C-C-C-O-C-C-C-O-) methylene 
      groups between the oxygen atoms are both insoluble in water. 
      The reason, however, is not so much that the O&middot;&middot;&middot;O 
      distances (2.18 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> and 4.79 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> respectively) fit 
      less well with the water cluster spacing but rather that the 
      molecules form almost-linear extended (rather than helical) 
      chains. These have  a pronounced hydrophobic character with a high 
      intra-molecular attraction. [<a title="click for an explanation" href="aqueous_biphasic.html#ba"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>
