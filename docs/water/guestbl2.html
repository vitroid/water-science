    Excellent overview of possibly the most amazing substance in 
    the universe. One suggestion: a section for kids that puts across 
    some of the ideas and concepts in an easy-to-understand way. 
    Key things that kids always ask (possibly due to standard school 
    curriculum homework assignments): why does an ice cube melt 
    faster in fresh water than in salt water? why does hot water 
    freeze faster than cold water? (your answer is excellent, but 
    too hard for the average kid to understand) where does the energy 
    come from when water freezes and expands? In other words: I'm 
    suggesting a sort of &quot;Easy-to-Understand Questions &amp; 
    Answers&quot; section.<br />

    This is great. really GREAT. I cannot imagine how much work 
    you put into it. I am currently doing a research on water psuedoscience. 
    Great way to understand what it really means. I just wanna ask 
    one question, this has been on my mind. R.O. (reverse osmosis) 
    water claims to be one of the purest water out there. I understand 
    that pure water cannot be acidic nor alkaline. R.O. water is 
    pH 6.5-6.8, which means it is not pure. Is this because of the 
    ineffeciency of R.O. water to filter volatile organic contaminants? <br />

    <strong>Excellent resource!</strong> I have been looking for this scope and quality of information 
    on water and its anomalous behavior for some time. Would you 
    be kind enough to share your insights into a particular problem 
    I am dealing with? I am trying to measure (to a precision of 
    1 millidegree) the melting temperature of very small (200-300nL) 
    aqueous solutions held in a glass capillary (&asymp; 200 micron ID,450 
    micron OD,1 cm long). I am using NaCl solutions with concentrations 
    that range up to 500 milliOsmoles/Kg H2O for testing purposes 
    as they have known freezing point depressions. The capillaries 
    are supercooled to &asymp; -25 deg C in an aluminum block to cause 
    sample nucleation and the temperature of the block is then slowly 
    ramped linearly to 0 deg C. The sample is backlit and the ice 
    crystals that form are viewed under a microscope. Temperature 
    is controlled / measured by a thermistor in the block adjacent 
    to the capillary and the &quot;melting point&quot; is identified 
    as the temperature at which the last ice crystal disappears. 
    My problem is getting repeatable melting temperatures using 
    such small samples. I get excellent results with larger samples 
    but they are an order of magnitude worse ( +/- 10 milllidegree 
    C)with those of 200-300nL. Would you have any suggestions as 
    to what might be at play here that causes an apparent volume 
    dependence in the repeatability ? Might the geometry of the 
    sample and surface effects between the sample and the glass 
    be a factor? Thank you in advance for any suggestions you might 
    provide.<br />

    replies: It is possible that (a) the ice is formed, initially 
    trapping some liquid water due to the large surface/volume ratio, 
    so that some (later-formed) ice is held at high pressure and/or 
    (b) gas bubbles are formed on freezing at the relatively large 
    glass/ice surface that partially insulates the ice. Any more 
    help from out there? </span>

    Is not the Mpemba phenom comparing apples to oranges? If one

    one would find that the first one in (now the cold water) would

    last to freeze. In other words - use the exact same water. <br />

    p. 93, vol. 5 (1993), p.71, vol. 7 (1996), p. 77, vol. 8 (1998),

    of Mr. Kronenberg. The references is IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, 
    Vol. Mag-21, No. 5, September 1985, pp. 2059-2061. Are there

    <strong>Dr. Chaplin</strong>: I salute you! Having read 
    lots of superficial/limited websites on hydrogen-bonding, I 
    was elated to stumble upon this one. A question: It's been noted 
    that histidine ligands in multinuclear Zn sites in proteins 
    &quot;stabilise the positive charge&quot; by donating an hbond 
    to a second-shell residue. How exactly does this hydrogen bond 
    compensate for the positive charge? Is it correct to say that 
    the positive ions polarise the N-H bond on the imidazole ring, 
    making it more likely to donate a hydrogen bond? Could we say 
    that any ligand would have a higher probability of donating 
    a bond?<br />

    <strong>Small Clusters vs. Hard Water</strong> Althought 
    the point is not very clear from a scientific point of view, 
    it has been suggested&nbsp; that small water clusters, with 
    lower surface tension, are good for you.&nbsp; However such

    <strong>Dietary fiber and hydrocolloids.</strong> Scientists 
    have suspected that plant fiber contains silica, which has been 
    proven to be necessary for the human diet. So the fact that 
    dietary fiber works, besides in helping aid digestion could 
    be the silicon content which is lacking in Western diets. Far 
    Eastern people have far better skin quality because of their 
    staple rice consumption which is high in powdered rice husks 
    known to be rich in silica content. Water promotes our body's 
    ability to absorb silica through a form of hydrocolloids. However 
    I have found out the reason why they are so well absorbed has 
    very much to do with our body's slow absorption process. If 
    the mineral salts are taken slowly, as in natural mineral water, 
    our ability to absorb is much better than taken in &quot;tablets&quot; 
    due to their high concentration. Taking mineral in dissolved 
    forms or minerals suspended in colloids actually improves our 
    ability to absorb them provided that they are taken slowly over 
    a period of a day instead of just &quot;popping pills&quot;<br />

    <strong>Dr. Chaplin</strong>, I am a chemist and an MD. 
    This material is really great for self learning, as a refreshment 
    course and for teaching to all levels. Thanks a lot. A suggestion: 
    it would be interesting to include water molecules in hydrated 
    crystals with different grades of hydration (one, two or more 
    water molecules associated to the crystal) as CaCl<sub>2</sub> (Calcium Chloride), Sodium Sulphate, etc. With my best regards.

    <strong>Dear Dr. Chaplin,</strong> this is an excellent 
    and instructive site. I have a question about H<sub>2</sub>O 
    and D<sub>2</sub>O. D<sub>2</sub>O seems to stabilize protein 
    complexes, including microtubules. I knew this idea years ago 
    when I was a undergraduate student on the cell biology course. 
    I do not have the textbook in hand, but I have just found several 
    old papers about that issue: Cell 1988, 52:935; Nature, 1969, 
    221(180):563; J Biol Chem 1970, 245(15):3733; J Cell Biol 1975, 
    64(1):42. The main point is that D<sub>2</sub>O really does 
    affect the assembly of protein complex. Do hydrogen bonds or 
    hydrophobic effects play important roles?&nbsp; I think this 
    could be helpful for this fascinating website. Best regards.<br />

    <strong><a name="mpemba" id="mpemba"></a>Dear Martin, </strong>Congratulations on a wonderful website. I disagree 
    with the explanation for the <a title="go to find more information"  href="mpemba_effect.html">Mpemba 
    effect</a>. Here in Philadelphia, we occasionally have some 
    very cold weather, low temperatures of 0 to -10F. During these 
    times, if a water pipe in your home is going to freeze, it is 
    invariably the hot water pipe that freezes first. Both pipes 
    have equilibrated to room temperature, 60 to 70F, and are at 
    the same pressure, 45 to 60 psi. The difference is that one 
    pipe contains water that began at perhaps 40F and slowly warmed 
    to room temperature, the other pipe started with the same water 
    but was heated to 120 to 150F before slowly cooling to room 
    temperature. I had always believed, perhaps incorrectly, that 
    the previously heated water freezes first because gas solubility 
    had been reduced by heating, the gas forms bubbles that had 
    not yet redissolved, and that dissolved gas trying to escape 
    during solidification has the effect of increasing pressure 
    and thus suppressing the solidification temperature (When molten 
    iron solidifies, the pressure of the gas generated can reach 
    several atmospheres, even when starting with only 30 ppm oxygen 
    in the liquid, and can cause an improperly handled ingot to 
    explode. People have been killed by this effect.). Another consideration 
    is that rejection of the solute gases is simply diffusion rate 
    dependent, and that in highly ordered systems diffusion becomes 
    a bit more difficult. Maybe the energy required to nucleate 
    a bubble in water near the freezing point is sufficient such 
    that the liquid with the fewest bubbles to nucleate wins the 
    freezing race.&nbsp;<br />

    <strong><a name="soper" id="soper"></a>Dear Professor Chaplin,</strong> A quick scan suggests it to be comprehensive and interesting 
    to read. Personally I would not classify the 2nd critical point 
    of water to be a confirmed anomaly at this stage - the evidence 
    is circumstantial at this stage and not conclusive. Given that 
    the purported 2nd critical point appears to be in a region of 
    the phase diagram which is currently unreachable, it could stay 
    that way for a while. There is still a school of thought that 
    says that high-density amorphous ice may simply be a highly 
    distorted crystal, although I don't follow that view myself. 
    As for water being easy to supercool, may be, but I have tried
