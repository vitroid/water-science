It is generally 
      accepted as having protective effects <a href="dietary_fiber.html#b" name="bb" id="bb"><sup>b</sup></a> against a range of diseases predominant in Western developed 
      countries   [<a href="ref17.html#r1608" name="r1608" title="go to cited reference" id="r1608">1608</a>], including colorectal cancer, <a href="dietary_fiber.html#d" name="bd" id="bd"><sup>d</sup></a> coronary heart disease [<a href="ref14.html#r1360" name="r1360" title="go to cited reference" id="r1360">1360</a>], diabetes, obesity, constipation  [<a href="ref27.html#r2682" name="r2682" title="go to cited reference" id="r2682">2682</a>], and diverticular 
      disease [<a href="ref29.html#r2828" name="r2828" title="go to cited reference" id="r2828">2828</a>]. They also may help control obesity by increasing satiety and reducing appetite within weight-loss programs [<a  href="ref16.html#r1528" name="r1528" title="go to cited reference" id="r1528">1528</a>]. Some have particularly beneficial effects in treating related conditions such as hypertension in the overweight  [<a href="ref13.html#r1258" name="r1258" title="go to cited reference" id="r1258">1258</a>].

The term 'dietary fiber' is commonly defined as plant 
      material that resists digestion by the secreted enzymes of 
      the human alimentary tract but which may be fermented by microflora 
      in the colon. As such, it includes most <a title="go for more information" href="hydrocolloids_gums.html">hydrocolloids</a>. After much debate, there is   now an acceptable  legal definition of 'dietary fiber' that includes carbohydrate polymers with one or more beneficial physiological effects [<a href="ref17.html#r1678" name="r1678" title="go to cited reference" id="r1678">1678</a>].<a href="dietary_fiber.html#e" name="be" id="be"><sup>e</sup></a> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Increased fiber consumption has been associated with lowering 
      total serum cholesterol and <abbr title="low density lipoprotein">LDL</abbr> cholesterol, modifying the glycemic and insulinemic response, 
      and protecting the large intestine from diseases. The lowered cholesterol concentrations are associated with highly viscous soluble fibers (e.g., guar gum, psyllium,
      and &beta;-glucan) rather than soluble, nonviscous, fermentable fibers (e.g., inulin). While the 
      physiological properties of a polysaccharide are challenging 
      to predict from structure alone, they are partly 
      predictable based on physicochemical properties such 
      as fermentation, water-holding capacity, viscosity, and bile 
      acid binding. A model of the effect of dietary fiber on digestion in the small intestine has been developed  [<a href="ref23.html#r2214" name="r2214" title="go to cited reference" id="r2214">2214</a>]. The main components of dietary fiber are 
      non-starch polysaccharides, including <a title="go for more information" href="cellulose.html">cellulose</a>, 
      hemicellulose (composed of  various  heteropolysaccharides 
      including <a title="go for more information" href="arabinoxylan.html">arabinoxylans</a>), <a title="go for more information" href="glucan.html">&beta;-glucan</a>,&nbsp; 
      and <a title="go for more information" href="pectin.html">pectins</a>. Resistant <a title="go for more information" href="starch.html">starch</a> is another major 
      component of plant foods that escapes absorption and digestion 
      in the small intestine and behaves, at least physiologically, 
      as dietary fiber. Non-digestible oligosaccharides have aroused significant interest 
       due to their ability to stimulate the growth of 
      potentially beneficial bacteria such as <em>Bifidobacteria</em>  and <em>Lactobacillus</em> in the gut  
      [<a href="ref3.html#r228" title="go to cited reference" >228</a>, <a href="ref35.html#r3469" name="r3469" title="go to cited reference" id="r3469">3469</a>] as well as other potential health benefits, including inhibition of intestinal infection and reduction in cancer risk [<a href="ref12.html#r1192" name="r1192" title="go to cited reference" id="r1192">1192</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The physiological properties of hydrocolloids [<a href="ref17.html#r1622" name="r1622" title="go to cited reference" id="r1622">1622</a>] are dependent on 
      the site, rate, and extent to which they are absorbed or fermented 
      in the intestine. Consumption of hydrocolloids  
      increases  stool weight, alters the gut transit time, alters the activity of 
      the colonic microflora, influences the appetite, absorbs toxins, and modifies 
      the absorption of fats, sugars, minerals, and bile acids. The extent 
      to which specific hydrocolloids exert their physiological effects 
      will be dependent on a complex mixture of structural, chemical, and 
      physical properties (summarized below).</p>

   <h2><a name="digest" id="digest"></a>The ffect of dietary fiber in digestion</h2>
 
    <p align="left">The path of food in our digestive tract is (see left): </p>
    <p align="left"><em> &nbsp;&nbsp;in &rarr; mouth &rarr; esophagus &rarr; stomach &rarr; small intestine (duodenum &rarr; jejunum &rarr; ileum) &rarr; colon &rarr; anus &rarr; out. </em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Dietary fiber has effects throughout the digestive tract. However, it is not changed (i.e., it remains undigested) until it gets to the colon when it may or may not be fermented, dependent on its structure (see <a href="dietary_fiber.html#colon">below</a>). The pH varies with passage through the digestive tract, with the pH of saliva, upper stomach, lower stomach, ileum, jejunum, small intestine, and large intestine being 6.5-7.5, 4.0-6.5, 1.5-4.0, 7.0-8.5, 4.0-7.0, 4.0-7.0, and 4.0-7.0, respectively, with the variations depending on the time of food intake.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Dietary fiber can affect satiety (fullness) by bulking foods, and increasing their viscosity and gelling in the stomach. These factors slow stomach (gastric) emptying and small intestine transit [<a href="ref27.html#r2612">2612</a><a name="r2612" id="r2612"></a>]. The   increased bulk and viscosity  together with any gel formation from the dietary fiber delays the hydrolysis and absorption of nutrients (such as amino acids, sugars, and fats) in the small intestine, leading to a more even delivery of nutrients throughout  the small intestine rather than mainly within the jejunum. Thus, more nutrients are delivered to the distal ileum with subsequent stimulation of feedback mechanisms, slowing gastric emptying, increasing small bowel transit time, and decreasing appetite  [<a href="ref27.html#r2612">2612</a>]. Within sufficient dietary fiber, some nutrients reach the colon, where they are fermented, losing half their calorie content.</p>

    <h2><a name="colon" id="colon"></a>The Colon </h2>
    <p>The colon is an essential part of our digestive tract and consists of several distinct areas (see right). <a href="dietary_fiber.html#f" name="bf" id="bf"><sup>f</sup></a> It contains the individual's  symbiotic microbiome, necessary for life and primarily involved in anaerobic fermentation. <a href="dietary_fiber.html#j" name="bj" id="bj"><sup>j</sup></a> The microorganisms are partially controlled by the diet   [<a href="ref36.html#r3560" name="r3560" title="go to cited reference" id="r3560">3560</a>], which determines the colonic metabolism, and impacts   human physiology  [<a href="ref35.html#r3474" name="r3474" title="go to cited reference" id="r3474">3474</a>]. The colon  is responsible for recovering ingested and secreted water and electrolytes, plus the salvage of energy from undigested food by fermentation.  The colon has a 'skin' about a millimeter thick with a high surface area of invaginations ('crypts') but covered with a thick layer of highly hydrophilic mucus (&asymp; 2% <a href="moles_molarity_molality.html#ww">w/v</a> of mainly MUC2 <a href="dietary_fiber.html#g" name="bg" id="bg"><sup>g</sup></a>) used as a lubricant and protective layer and associated with high-density water. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The highly hydrated mucus is required as the colon is exposed to numerous hazards and is heavily colonized by microorganisms that must be kept separated from the epithelium (body lining). The healthy consequence is that mucus encapsulates the fecal stools (containing most of the bacteria), which are further covered in the distal colon (descending, sigmoid and rectal colons) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4127">4127</a><a name="r4127" id="r4127"></a>].</p>

    <p>Every day about 60 g solids and 1600 mL water iare ingested with about a further  7 liters of water secreted in the upper digestive tract. The size of the human colon is not well known and much smaller than commonly quoted, with its variable volume (about 0.5 L),  containing about 20% gas and about  4 &#739; 10<sup>13</sup> bacteria [<a href="ref25.html#r2485" name="r2485" title="go to cited reference" id="r2485">2485</a>] (similar to the number of human cells in a human body). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Digested food from the small intestine, containing the excess secreted water, enters the ascending colon at the lower right-hand side of the body (on the left in the diagram). The ascending colon squeezes in pulses (with the contained material rising and falling)  when most of this excess water is  recovered. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the material becomes more solid and less liquid, its viscosity increases and eventually, it passes over the top into the transverse colon. Water continues to be removed along with fermentation products (see below) in the transverse colon and into the descending colon, where fecal matter gathers. The sigmoid colon is surrounded by muscle that contracts to expel this matter through the rectum. The food takes about two days to travel through the digestive tract with this time spent mostly in the colon. The fecal output (about 130 mL, and containing about 19 g dry weight of bacteria) contains only about 11 mL of free water and  18 g of non-bacterial solids; the remainder is bound water. </p>

    <p>As the material travels through the colon, the organisms present extract energy by rearranging their atoms, generally by removing the more hydrophilic  parts such as carbon dioxide and  short-chain fatty acids. Such an environment tends to keep carcinogenic hydrophobic materials( from the diet or formed by fermentation) away from the live cells of the colon wall, so reducing any cancer risks. Consequently, the molecules that remain are either non-fermentable (e.g., 3,4-benzpyrene and other polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons from smoked foods plus the natural bile acid lithocholic acid) or fermentation products (e.g., heterocyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons particularly tryptophan metabolites, such as Trp-P-1, from cooked red meat and other  high-quality protein,  fecapentaene-12: from anaerobic  organisms and N-nitroso-dimethylamine from protein and nitrates). Many of these are quite hydrophobic (see right with their relative hydrophobicities<a href="dietary_fiber.html#h" name="bh" id="bh"><sup>h</sup></a>) and associated with cancer. As the fermentation is progressive through the colon, it is not surprising that the highest concentration of such molecules is at the colon's distal end, which is associated with the higher risk of cancer here, even with the progressively thicker mucus layer (see table below).</p>

    <p>Within the colon, there are several aqueous environments. The two most important of these are formed by   mucus and dietary fiber. These  form separated aqueous  compartments (i.e., phases), whether they are  completely dissolved or not. Also, dietary fiber can combine with intestinal mucus to produce a denser layer that significantly delays the transport of hydrophobic materials [<a href="ref26.html#r2561">2561</a><a name="r2561" id="r2561"></a>]. The properties of these aqueous phases depend on  the structure of the macromolecules and consist of low-density water  around the fermented dietary fiber residue and higher-density water throughout the mucus. These conditions will  encourage the partition of carcinogens and potential carcinogens and protective  agents between the phases in such a way as to be potentially either protective  or harmful. Further, as the material passes through the colon, the action of  microorganisms changes the properties of the phases in a way that  may be either beneficial or harmful, depending on their structure. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The  concentration of the carcinogens within the mucus towards the rectum coincides  with increased cancer prevalence. Dietary fiber generally tends  to partition hydrophobic carcinogens away from this mucus and towards the  partially fermented dietary fiber, so reducing cancer risk. When more unfermented fiber is present, a low-density water environment with greater aqueous volume is produced, which will further extract the hydrophobic molecules so causing a further reduction in their concentration within the mucus and hence in harmful contact with the live cells beneath [<a href="ref19.html#r1806" name="r1806" title="go to cited reference" id="r1806">1806</a>]; the fiber and mucus environments behaving like a 'typical' partitioning <a href="aqueous_biphasic.html">aqueous biphasic system.</a> High stool weight and throughput with a high-fiber diet are associated with low colon cancer occurrence. In contrast, low fiber diets and constipation are more associated with increased cancer risk due to the longer contact time and low water content with consequent lower partitioning within the fecal material.</p>

    <h2><a name="ferm" id="ferm"></a>Colonic Fermentation</h2>
    <p>The rate,  extent, and site of hydrocolloid fermentation in the gut 
      are dependent on several factors, including solubility, chemical 
      structure, availability of other more readily fermentable substrates, 
      and the composition of the colonic microflora  [<a href="ref20.html#r1927" name="r1927" title="go to cited reference" id="r1927">1927</a>]. Hydrocolloids, generally 
      being relatively pure additives, are more available than typical 
      dietary fiber, which is naturally complexed with plant material and often 
      consumed as whole grains. Water-soluble hydrocolloids are more readily 
      available and will be fermented earlier in the colon than insoluble 
      hydrocolloids, so long as suitable microbial enzymes are available. 
      Terminal residues are fermented first, and hydrocolloids containing <a title="go for more information" href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#arab">&alpha;-L-arabinofuranose</a> or <a title="go for more information" href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#polar">&alpha;-D-galacturonic 
      acid</a> residues are generally more susceptible to fermentation. 
      Of the major components of dietary fiber, <a title="go for more information" href="arabinoxylan.html">xylans</a>, <a title="go for more information" href="pectin.html">pectins</a>, and gums are significantly fermented 
      in the gut, seaweed polysaccharides less so, <a title="go for more information" href="cellulose.html">cellulose</a> is only partially broken 
      down, and lignin is essentially an inert material. <a title="go for more information" href="starch.html#rs">Resistant 
      starch</a>, which forms a significant part of the substrate available 
      for colonic fermentation, is completely degraded in the large bowel 
      and probably has a significant role in the protection systems associated 
      with carbohydrate fermentation. Insoluble fibers are difficult to 
      digest because a two-phase reaction is involved. However, insoluble particles 
      (for example, <a title="go for more information" href="starch.html#rs">resistant starch</a>) may 
      provide a surface for the growth of bacterial microcolonies in fermentative 
      processes. Exactly where and how quickly fermentation takes place 
      is important. Some soluble fibers become partially insoluble due to hydrolysis by gut enzymes, but conformational 'persistence' 
      may prevent the fiber from precipitating while in the colon. There 
      is a time lag before precipitation and, if there is insufficient 
      time for the fiber to precipitate, it persists in solution. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The 
      most significant end-products of colonic fermentation are the short-chain fatty 
      acids (SCFA) acetic, propionic, and butyric, and the gases carbon 
      dioxide, hydrogen, and methane. <abbr title="short chain fatty acids">Short-chain fatty 
      acids</abbr> are an essential energy source for anaerobic bacteria and may play 
      a role in preventing colorectal cancer. Butyrate directs colonic surface cells to use up remaining oxygen through the &beta;-oxidation pathway. Keeping the colon anaerobic offers protection against the growth of  pathogenic bacteria, such as <em>Escherichia coli </em>and <em>Salmonella, </em>that can lead to bowel disease [<a href="ref31.html#r3011" name="r3011" title="go to cited reference" id="r3011">3011</a>]. The <abbr title="short chain fatty acids">SCFA</abbr> also represent 
      a significant salvage of energy for the body, recovering about half 
      the energy that would have been available had the hydrocolloid been 
      digested and absorbed in the small intestine. <abbr title="short chain fatty acids">SCFA</abbr> lowers the intestinal pH resulting in enzymatic inhibition of the 
      7-&alpha;-dehydroxylase, which catalyzes secondary 
      bile acid formation, and further reduces secondary bile 
      acid concentrations due to precipitation. Lower colonic pH may also 
      change the composition of the gut flora to one less prone to produce 
      carcinogens. Butyrate has been proposed to have a direct role in 
      colorectal cancer prevention due to its ability to inhibit colon 
      carcinoma cell growth<em> in vivo</em>. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Specific hydrocolloids may 
      vary in both the composition and total concentration of <abbr title="short chain fatty acids">SCFA</abbr> produced during colonic fermentation. When incubated with human fecal 
      microflora, hydrolyzed <a title="go for more information" href="guar_gum.html">guar gum</a> produces the highest levels of 
      total <abbr title="short chain fatty acids">SCFA</abbr> compared 
      with other dietary fiber sources. <a title="go for more information" href="cellulose.html">Cellulose</a> produces significantly 
      higher levels of propionate. <a title="go for more information" href="arabinoxylan.html">Arabinoxylan</a> oligosaccharides alter the bacterial composition 
      of the colon beneficially  by stimulating the growth of bacteria 
      from the genera <em>Bifidobacteria</em> in preference to the potentially 
      more harmful anaerobic bacteria such as <em>Clostridium spp</em>. 
      Similarly, <a title="go for more information" href="guar_gum.html">galactomannans</a> are readily fermented 
      by the beneficial organisms <em>Bifidobacteria</em> and <em>Lactobacilli</em>. <a title="go for more information" href="starch.html#rs">Resistant starch</a>, however, has been 
      reported to stimulate the growth of the more anaerobic <em>Clostridia</em> species. </p>

    <p>There are connections between a person's (healthy) gut flora, their mothers when in the womb, and aspects of their general and mental health  [<a href="ref19.html#r1864" name="r1864" title="go to cited reference" id="r1864">1864</a>], but the details of this still have to be established.

    <h2><a name="hold" id="hold"></a>Water-holding capacity (WHC)</h2>
    <p>As the primary function of hydrocolloids is to retain water, they 
      have an important effect on stool bulking and consequently on gut 
      transit times as a high water-holding capacity&nbsp;forces the material 
      through the gut faster. There is a laxative benefit with insoluble fibers that irritate the bowel wall to stimulate water secretion and with gel-forming fiber that retains water so resisting dehydration. Increased stool weight can cause dilution 
      of the intraluminal contents limiting the gut's exposure  to 
      secondary bile acids and other toxins and potential carcinogens. 
      The water holding capacity (WHC) of a hydrocolloid is related to 
      the primary chemical structure, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, 
      and the particle size. Water-insoluble fibers, such as <a title="go for more information" href="cellulose.html">cellulose</a>, 
      although having relatively low water content, retain water in pores, 
      and energy is required to remove it. <abbr title="water holding capacity">WHC</abbr> increases with particle size due to the greater number of pores 
      and voids in the sponge-like matrix. Conversely, <a title="go for more information" href="pectin.html">pectins</a> and <a title="go for more information" href="guar_gum.html">guar gum</a> are almost entirely fermented 
      in the gut and, despite high initial <abbr title="water holding capacity">WHC</abbr>, 
      have little effect on transit time. The stiffness of a hydrocolloid 
      network may be ia factor in delaying the escape of gas (by preventing 
      gas bubbles coalescing), reducing stool density and increasing 
      stool bulk. </p>

    <h2><a name="visc" id="visc"></a>Viscosity and gel formation</h2>
    <p><a title="go for more information" href="hydrocolloids_gums.html">Hydrocolloids</a> may be categorized as either 
      water-soluble (for example, <a title="go for more information" href="pectin.html">pectins</a> and <a title="go for more information" href="guar_gum.html">guar</a>) or water-insoluble (<a title="go for more information" href="cellulose.html">cellulose</a>), 
      though this labeling is not always helpful in predicting their physiological 
      effects. Soluble hydrocolloids are noted for their effect on the 
      stomach and the small intestine. In contrast, insoluble fibers are noted 
      for their effect on the large intestine, though some hydrocolloids 
    (for example, <a title="go for more information" href="arabinoxylan.html">arabinoxylans</a>) affect both. Consumption of soluble dietary fiber is  commonly recommended as part of a healthy diet, with soluble fiber   as an active ingredient in functional foods [<a href="ref36.html#r3554" name="r3554" title="go to cited reference" id="r3554">3554</a>]. The extent of pre-processing, including cooking, affects 
      the rate of solubilization in the intestine, as does particle size 
      (smaller particles have larger exposed surface areas for their weight). 
      Also, the type and regularity of branching present affect both the solubility 
      and the extent of the exposed hydrophobic surface. These factors 
      contribute to the hydrodynamic volume of a polysaccharide and hence 
      its <a title="go for more information" href="rheology.html">viscosity</a>. The entanglement of polymer 
      chains increases viscosity, which depends on about the fifth power 
      of concentration. Above the critical concentration (C*, see <a title="go for more information" href="rheology.html">rheology</a>), 
      even if fermentation reduces the size of a polysaccharide molecule 
      fourfold, the viscosity will increase eight-fold when half the water 
      is removed in the ascending&nbsp;colon. The high viscosity associated 
      with hydrocolloids is often given as the cause of their effect on 
      glucose and lipid metabolism (that is, reducing hyperglycemia); 
      the consequent high viscosity of the intestinal contents reducing 
      the rate of absorption of fat, glucose, and nutrients, so allowing 
      their absorption along a greater length of the small intestine and 
      flattening the absorption profile.

    <p><em>In vitro</em> binding of bile acids by specific components of 
    dietary fiber has been well documented. Bile acids are a group of 
    related amphiphilic steroids, possessing both a hydrophilic and 
    a hydrophobic face. The primary bile acids, cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic 
    acid are synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and released 
    into the bile conjugated to glycine or taurine  to solubilize 
    fats and cholesterol for uptake in the small intestine. In the colon, 
    bile acids that are not absorbed and recycled by the enterohepatic 
    circulation are mostly deconjugated and 7-dehydroxylated to give 
    the secondary bile acids, deoxycholic, and lithocholic acid. Conjugation 
    and the presence of hydroxyl groups give the primary bile acids 
    more hydrophilic character, whereas deoxycholic acid and lithocholic 
    acid are more lipophilic.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The effects of pH, the available 
      surface area, and the sterol 's hydrophobicity  have been shown to affect the absorption 
      of bile acids to certain hydrocolloids. The 
      adsorption capacity of bile acids to wheat, corn, oat, barley, and 
      rice fibers was favored by an acidic pH environment, extensive hydrophobic 
      surface area, and greater hydrophobicity of the bile acid. Adsorption 
      of bile acids by dietary fiber is one of the proposed mechanisms 
      for the hypocholesterolemic effect of dietary fiber. Increased fecal 
      excretion of bile acids leads to the increased cholesterol 
      metabolism in the liver, thus lowering serum cholesterol levels. Evidence in 
      human subjects suggests that soluble fibers such as <a title="go for more information" href="pectin.html">pectin</a>, <a title="go for more information" href="arabinoxylan.html">psyllium</a>, <a title="go for more information" href="guar_gum.html">guar,</a> and <a title="go for more information" href="glucan.html">oat bran</a> are effective serum cholesterol-lowering agents [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1360">1360</a>] and also slows gastric emptying, increases perceived satiety, and plays a significant role in appetite regulation. Bile acids are implicated in the etiology of colon cancer [<a href="ref3.html#r229" name="r229" title="go to cited reference" id="r229">229</a>]. 
      Several studies have shown that colorectal cancer patients have 
      higher levels of secondary bile acids both entering and leaving 
      the colon. There is a strong relationship between cereal fiber consumption 
      and the prevention of colorectal cancer. Many of the most effective 
      dietary fibers contain <a title="go for more information" href="arabinoxylan.html">arabinoxylans</a>. Cereal 
      fibers are particularly effective at binding or partitioning putative 
      co-carcinogens such as fecapentaenes, heterocyclic amines, and secondary 
      bile acids into the   fiber matrix, thus reducing their cytotoxic 
      effect. These carcinogens/promoters are then carried out of the 
      body by undigested insoluble fiber, thus lowering their effective 
      concentrations in the intestinal tract. The exact nature of the 
       bile acids and dietary fiber interactionis is unclear but 
      likely to be hydrophobic.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Several properties allow a polysaccharide to bind bile acids. A 
      high degree of order on the surface affects binding as bile acids 
      are stiff molecules and require an ordered static surface with which 
      to bind. An extensive hydrophobic surface also promotes binding. In addition, 
      the presence of soluble fiber may influence how much bile acid binds 
      to the insoluble fiber that is present. Low-density water near the 
      surface of a polysaccharide increases the likelihood of bile acids 
      binding to hydrophobic areas, and low-density water is created mainly 
      by stiff-type molecules. There may be <a title="go for more information" href="aqueous_biphasic.html">aqueous 
      biphasic</a> effects, and   lignin and other hydrophobic 
      molecules may also be important. Lithocholic acid (a major secondary 
      bile acid) exists in chains when it is crystalline. It persists 
      in solution and may 'sit' on ordered <a title="go for more information" href="arabinoxylan.html">arabinoxylan</a> structures. The length of bile acids is equivalent to that of three 
      carbohydrate residues, and consequently, molecules with three carbohydrates 
      in an ordered structure should bind more readily.
