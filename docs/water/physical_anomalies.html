    <h2> F1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name="Visc" id="Visc"></a>High <a title="go to 'Water properties data' page"  href="water_properties.html#Viscosity">viscosity</a> (0.89 cP, compare pentane 0.22 cP, at 25&nbsp;&deg;C)</h2>
    <p> The viscosity of a liquid is the efficiency  with which it flows and is determined by the ease with which molecules 
      can move relative to each other. It depends on the intermolecular forces and molecular momentum exchange. At lower temperatures (&lt; 40&nbsp;&deg;C) in water, the dominant forces are those holding 
      the molecules together (cohesiveness) [<a href="ref36.html#r3535" name="r3535" title="go to cited reference" id="r3535">3535</a>]. This cohesiveness is large in water due to 
    its extensive three-dimensional hydrogen bonding, and ( at these low temperatures) the viscosity is proportional to the wavenumber of the O-H stretching of water [<a href="ref36.html#r3539" name="r3539" title="go to cited reference" id="r3539">3539</a>]. As the hydrogen bonds change with the velocity of flow, the flow-rate affects the viscosity of water [<a href="ref36.html#r3539" title="go to cited reference">3539</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It should be noted 
      that although the viscosity of water is high, it is not so high that it causes 
      too much difficulty being moved around within organisms. The Arrhenius 
      energy of activation for viscous flow is similar to the hydrogen 
      bond energy&nbsp; (H<sub>2</sub>O, 21.5 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>; D<sub>2</sub>O, 
      24.7 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>; T<sub>2</sub>O, 26.2 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>, 
      all calculated from [<a href="ref.html#r73" name="r73b" title="go to cited reference" id="r73b">73</a>]; all 
    at 0&nbsp;&deg;C and all more than doubling at -30&nbsp;&deg;C).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As with other liquids the kinematic viscosity of water has a minimum; this is of interest but not an anomaly. The minimum occurs at about 700 K at 100 MPa (~10<sup>&minus;7 </sup>m<sup>2</sup> &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4384">4384</a><a name="r4384" id="r4384"></a>].

    <p>The increase in the viscosity with lower temperatures is particularly noticeable within supercooled water (see opposite). The water cluster <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#Fig2">equilibrium</a> shifts towards the more open structure (for example, <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>) as the temperature is lowered. This structure is formed 
      by stronger hydrogen bonding. In turn, this creates 
      larger clusters and reduces the ease of movement (increasing 
      viscosity).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is similar behavior with the dynamic viscosity (&eta;) of D<sub>2</sub>O where    </p>

    <p>The Prandtl number  is a dimensionless number that compares energy convection and conduction. <em>Pr</em> &#8810; 1 means thermal conduction dominates over thermal convection (heat diffuses faster than matter moves; as with liquid mercury), whereas <em>Pr</em> &#8811; 1 means that convection is more effective in transferring energy away from an area, compared to  conduction; as with motor oils. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is a minimum in <em>Pr</em> at 254.7&nbsp;&deg;C (<em>Pr</em> = 0.8313) [<a href="ref6.html#r540">540</a><a name="r540" id="r540"></a>].</p>

        decreases with pressure (at temperatures below 33&nbsp;&deg;C)</h2>
      <p> Viscous flow occurs by molecules moving through the voids 
        that exist between them. As the pressure increases, the volume 
        decreases, and the volume of these voids reduces, so usually 
        rising pressure increases the viscosity. Water behaves anomalously below about 30&nbsp;&deg;C, at low pressures, increasing pressure reduces viscosity instead of increasing it  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2891">2891</a><a name="r2891" id="r2891"></a>]. The viscosity passes through a pressure minimum and then increases.</p>

      <p>Water's pressure-viscosity behavior [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r534">534</a><a name="r534" id="r534"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2890">2890</a><a name="r2890" id="r2890"></a>] can be explained by the increased pressure (up to about 
      100-200 MPa) causing deformation, so reducing the strength 
      of the hydrogen-bonded network, which is also partially 
      responsible for the viscosity. This reduction in cohesiveness 
      more than compensates for the reduced void volume. It 
      is thus a direct consequence of the <a href="clusters_overview.html">balance</a> between hydrogen-bonding effects and the <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> dispersion forces [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r558">558</a><a name="r558" id="r558"></a>] 
      in water, with hydrogen-bonding prevailing at lower temperatures 
      and pressures. At higher pressures (and densities), the <a href="clusters_overview.html">balance</a> between hydrogen-bonding 
      effects and the van der Waals dispersion forces is tipped 
      in favor of the dispersion forces. The remaining <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen 
        bonds</a> are stronger due to the close proximity of 
      the contributing oxygen atoms [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r655">655</a><a name="r655" id="r655"></a>].

      <p>The dashed lines

The <a href="cluster_evidence.html#2phas">two-state model</a> has been used to explain the minima, with the strongly hydrogen-bonded and structured low-density water being converted to high-density water under pressure, due to bending and breakage of the hydrogen bonds [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2890">2890</a>].</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The variation of viscosity with pressure and temperature

        more by the extent of hydrogen bonding rather than hydrogen 
        bonding strength [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref9.html#r824">824</a><a name="r824" id="r824"></a>].</p>

      <p>Self-diffusion is also affected by pressure where (at

        &#739; cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>, at low temperatures) is in contrast to normal liquids 
      where increasing density decreases self-diffusion as the molecules 
      restrict each other's movements; i.e., liquid water becomes more fluid when squeezed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The density increase may 
      be due to increasing temperature, below 4&nbsp;&deg;C, at atmospheric 
      pressure or due to increasing pressure at low temperatures. 
      Liquids typically show reduced self-diffusion when they are 
      squeezed. However, water at 0&nbsp;&deg;C increases its diffusivity by 
      8% under a pressure of about 200 MPa [<a href="ref3.html#r226" name="r226" title="go to cited reference" id="r226">226</a>], 
      and the diffusivity of supercooled water at -30&nbsp;&deg;C increases 
      by 60% with a similar pressure increase. The temperature limit for this anomalous behavior is &asymp; 42&nbsp;&deg;C &plusmn;5&nbsp;&deg;C in agreement with the limit of the <a href="density_anomalies.html#Tcomp">compressibility anomaly</a> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1970" name="r1970" id="r1970">1970</a>]. Further increase 
      in pressure reduces the diffusivity in common with the behavior 
      of other liquids. The movement of water becomes restricted 
      at low temperatures as the more open (lower density) structure 
      produced on cooling (<a title="go to find more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#Tvisc">see above</a>) 
      is formed by stronger and more complete hydrogen bonding, 
      which reduces the self-diffusion. </p>

      (above and  left) indicate the diffusivity maxima. The  <a href="cluster_evidence.html#2phas">two-state mode</a> has been used to explain the maxima.

Simulation studies have shown that self-diffusion 
      goes through a minimum as the density of water is reduced 
      below about 0.9 g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> followed by an increase 
      with further density reduction, as might be expected from 
      most liquids [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref5.html#r402">402</a><a name="r402" id="r402"></a>], 
      due to the disruption of the network at low-density as the 
      now-stretched hydrogen bonds are broken [<a href="ref7.html#r626" name="r626" title="go to cited reference" id="r626">626</a>]. The maximum in the self-diffusion  is brought about as at even higher pressures (&gt; 200 MPa) there is an increased

    <p><a name="stt" id="stt"></a>From a  simple theory [<a href="ref42.html#r4117" name="r4117" title="go to cited reference" id="r4117">4117</a>], the surface tension should be a function of the temperature difference from the critical point (&prop;<a href="greek.html#rho">&rho;</a><sup>2/3</sup>). This is observed approximately for most liquids  but not for water [<a href="ref42.html#r4118" name="r4118" title="go to cited reference" id="r4118">4118</a>]. There is no apparent anomaly in the surface 
      tension/temperature behavior <abbr title = "International Assosiation for the Properties of Water and Steam">[<a href="http://www.iapws.org/relguide/Surf-H2O-2014.pdf" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin3" onclick="newWin('otherWin3')">IAPWS</a>] above the deeply supercooled regime</abbr>. 
      There were inflection points reported at about  +4&nbsp;&deg;C [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref9.html#r865">865</a><a name="r865" id="r865"></a>] 
      and 256&nbsp;&deg;C [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2142">2142</a><a name="r2142" id="r2142"></a>] (262&nbsp;&deg;C [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref5.html#r427">427</a><a name="r427" id="r427"></a>]). The high-temperature anomaly has been found to coincide with the maximum in the surface enthalpy and the hydrogen bonding percolation threshold of water molecules at the liquid-vapor interface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3971">3971</a><a name="r3971" id="r3971"></a>]. The low-temperature inflection point was explained by use of a two-state mixture model involving 
      low-density, and higher density water clusters [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref9.html#r866">866</a><a name="r866" id="r866"></a>]. However, this anomaly has not been found using the capillary elevation method [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2142">2142</a>] or a counter-pressure capillary rise method [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2632">2632</a><a name="r2632" id="r2632"></a>]. There is, however a significant positive deviation from the extrapolated surface tension behavior below 235 K consistent with the tail of an exponential growth in surface tension as temperature decreases [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2737">2737</a><a name="r2737" id="r2737"></a>]. This is thought due to support the coexistence of two liquid forms in pure water of macroscopic size at these low temperatures. In 2020, a significant deviation from the extrapolated <abbr title = "International Assosiation for the Properties of Water and Steam">[<a href="http://www.iapws.org/relguide/Surf-H2O-2014.pdf" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin3" onclick="newWin('otherWin3')">IAPWS</a>] </abbr>formulation for the surface tension of ordinary water was detected below 253 K (-20&nbsp;&deg;C) in agreement with an anomaly in the course of surface tension in the deeply supercooled region [<a href="ref40.html#r3949" name="r3949" title="go to cited reference" id="r3949">3949</a>].<br />
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>However, the <a title="click for more information" href="water_properties.html#senth">surface enthalpy</a>/ temperature behavior is anomalous, with a clear minimum at the <a href="density_anomalies.html#density">temperature of maximum density</a>.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="physical_anomalies.html#g">a</a><a name="bg" id="bg"></a></sup> This is a consequence of the minimum in the <a title="click for more information" href="water_properties.html#dgdt">surface entropy</a>/ temperature behavior.   Using molecular simulations there is a clear local minimum in the surface excess entropy (&Delta;S/Area) at a temperature ~240-250 K, indicating a second inflection point   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r3547">3547</a><a name="r3547" id="r3547"></a>]. This is due to the <a href="water_models.html">SPC/E</a> water surface being denser than expected at these low temperatures. An interesting, if usually ignored, phenomenon is the linear reduction of surface tension with increasing relative <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#l">humidity</a>; &asymp; 0.1% drop per 1% increase in humidity at 5&nbsp;&deg;C  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1854">1854</a><a name="r1854" id="r1854"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Surface tension changes differently from bulk water 
      properties due to surface enrichment with water clusters. The effect of microwave irradiation on the surface tension of water also shows unique properties, with the water surface tension remaining well below its original value for an extended period  (minutes after the return of the temperature) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2208">2208</a><a name="r2208" id="r2208"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The more  significant  than expected drop in <a title="click for more information" href="water_properties.html#dgdt">surface tension with temperature</a> increase (0.155 
      mJ   &#739; m<sup>&minus;2</sup>   &#739; K<sup>&minus;1</sup> at 25&nbsp;&deg;C) is one of the highest known and similar to that of the liquid metals. It has been quantitatively explained using spherically 
      symmetrical water clustering [<a href="ref4.html#r376" name="r376" title="go to cited reference" id="r376">376</a>]. The thermodynamic change in <a title="click for more information" href="water_properties.html#dgdp">surface tension with pressure </a> is very high at 25&nbsp;&deg;C [<a href="ref13.html#r1280">1280</a><a name="r1280" id="r1280"></a>]. <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="physical_anomalies.html#e"> e</a></sup></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is interesting to note that surfactants lower the surface 
      tension because they prefer to sit within the surface layer, attracting 
      the surface water molecules in competition to the bulk water 
      hydrogen-bonding and  reducing the net forces away from 
      the surface (that is, the surface tension). Many organic molecules, both hydrophilic (ethanol) and hydrophobic (neopentane), prefer the surface of the water to its bulk  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1889">1889</a><a name="r1889" id="r1889"></a>].</p>

        <p>The high surface tension of water endows it with some rather unexpected properties. Thus, water drops may rise up an inclined plate against gravity if subjected to symmetrical vibrations of about 100 Hz [<a href="ref14.html#r1311" name="r1311" title="go to cited reference" id="r1311">1311</a>]. This is due to the unequal changes in contact angle at the top and bottom surfaces, creating upwards forces greater than that due to gravity and the nonlinear friction effects. High surface tension is responsible for many biological effects, including the ease with which water produces lingering clouds of small droplets  (aerosols) that can spread pathogens widely from sneezes and high flush toilets  [<a href="ref23.html#r2259" name="r2259" title="go to cited reference" id="r2259">2259</a>]. The water surface can support insects on its surface (see above left) or hanging from its surface (see above right). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>From the data on charged droplets [<a href="ref27.html#r2660">2660</a><a name="r2660" id="r2660"></a>], surface charge gives rise to a <a href="nanobubble.html#st">significant reduction in surface tension</a>. Also, if a small drop of water (typically 
      1 mm diameter) is coated in a fine (typically 20 &mu;m 
      diameter) hydrophobic dust, then the drop can roll and bounce 
      without leakage [<a href="ref3.html#r225" name="r225" title="go to cited reference" id="r225">225</a>], 
      and the aqueous spheres can even float on water. <a name="bj" id="bj"></a><sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="physical_anomalies.html#j">j</a></sup> Capillarity 
      holds the dust at the air-liquid interface, with the elasticity 
      being due to the high surface tension. Similar material is known as 'dry water', behaving as a dry powder but releasing &asymp; 95%-98% liquid water on a mechanical action such as rubbing on the skin in cosmetics [<a href="ref17.html#r1660" name="r1660" title="go to cited reference" id="r1660">1660</a>]. This 'dry water' powder  can efficiently take up and hold large amounts of CO<sub>2</sub> as its clathrate (&asymp; 25%  CO<sub>2</sub> by weight) [<a href="ref20.html#r1929" name="r1929" title="go to cited reference" id="r1929">1929</a>].

    <p>There is a shallow minimum in the surface tension of many ions at very 
      low ionic concentrations (known as the Jones-Ray effect 
      [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r674">674</a><a name="r674" id="r674"></a>]; first 
      dismissed erroneously as an artifact by Irving Langmuir  
      [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1518">1518</a><a name="r1518" id="r1518"></a>]). 
      It has been definitively demonstrated that the Jones-Ray effect is not caused by surface-active impurities [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3464">3464</a><a name="r3464" id="r3464"></a>]. At low concentration (&lt; 1 mM), the surface 
    tension of KCl solutions drops (&asymp; -0.01% change) with increasing concentration. A decreasing surface tension usually corresponds to a surface enhancement,   whereas an increased surface tension corresponds to a surface deficit of the material. However, in this case, the drop in surface tension has been attributed to a bulk effect rather than a surface effect [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref26.html#r2550">2550</a><a name="r2550" id="r2550"></a>]. At such low concentrations, the decrease in &Delta;&gamma; does not stem from the surface segregation of the bare ions but rather from the relative stability of the weakly oriented water surrounding the bulk ions. An increase in the orientational order of the water hydrogen-bond network entails an entropic penalty that is greater in the bulk than at the surface, leading to a net favorable interaction with the surface and, hence, to a decrease in &Delta;&gamma;.</p>

    <p><a name="salt2" id="salt2"></a>The supposed preference of 
      H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> for the surface in some acid solutions (presumed due to its likely surface active nature, as its O atom is not hydrogen-bonded) is indicated by the slight drop in surface tension with high HCl, HNO<sub>3</sub>, and HClO<sub>4</sub> acid concentrations (see right, [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2396">2396</a><a name="r2396" id="r2396"></a>]). However, the anion is critical as the same effect is not shown by H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; thus the H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ions in H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solutions show no preference for the surface. Also, NH<sub>4</sub>OH (but not NH<sub>4</sub>Cl or NaOH) shows a much more marked reduction in surface tension with concentration than these acids, which by a similar, if possibly an equally erroneous argument, might indicate a greater preference of hydroxide ion for the surface.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="physical_anomalies.html#h"> h</a><a name="bh" id="bh"></a></sup> The surface-active nature of these acids and bases is more easily and more consistently explained by the formation of uncharged species (for example, HCl, NH<sub>3</sub>) at the surface, coincident with their volatility (HCl forms 10% ion-pairs  [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2654">2654</a><a name="r2654" id="r2654"></a>]). Since writing this, the effect has been confirmed for HCl and HNO<sub>3 </sub> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2190">2190</a><a name="r2190" id="r2190"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The drop in surface tension with surface-active acids is easily explainable due to greater entropy at the surface and hence lower surface energy as given by the Gibbs  adsorption equation:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"> <strong>-d&gamma; = &Sigma;<sub>i</sub> (&Gamma;<sub>i</sub>d&mu;<sub>i</sub>) </strong></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>where d&gamma; is surface tension change, &Gamma; (capital Gamma) is the surface excess of component i, and &mu; is  the chemical potential of component i.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The slight rise in surface tension with  salts is less easy to understand but is thought due to the relative depletion of salt within the surface, which means that when such ions do absorb near the surface a depletion layer closer to the surface must also be created.  Also, higher concentrations of such salts must disproportionately 
      increase  the attractive 
      forces on the surface water molecules, consequently adding to the increase in
      the surface tension. This has been further explained by the salts being at a lower concentration nearer the outside due (1) to their need for hydration on all sides, and hence residence away from the outside surface, and (2) their '<a href="interfacial_water.html#image_charge" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin81" onclick="newWin('otherWin81')">image charges</a>' repelling them from the surface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2397">2397</a><a name="r2397" id="r2397"></a>]. Although the outside surface of the water is apparently no different from 'pure' water, it must be more organized (lower entropy) due to the salt-organized hydration water just under this surface and thus causing the rise in surface energy (surface tension).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="kosmotropes_chaotropes.html" title="more on kosmotropes and chaotropes">Kosmotropic cations 
      and anions</a> prefer to be fully hydrated in the bulk liquid 
      water and  increase the surface tension by the latter mechanism 
      at all concentrations [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1885">1885</a><a name="r1885" id="r1885"></a>]. This partitioning is noticeable in 
      NaCl solutions, such as seawater; the weakly chaotropic Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> occupying surface sites, whereas the weakly kosmotropic Na<sup>+</sup> only resides further from the surface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref10.html#r928">928</a><a name="r928" id="r928"></a>]. 
      The polarizability of large chaotropic anions (such as I<sup>&minus;</sup>) 
      is accentuated due to the asymmetric solvent distribution

    <p>Interestingly the surface tension of pure (no CO<sub>2</sub>) water shows little change with pH over the range of pH 1 - 13 on adjusting with just HCl or NaOH, except for a small local minimum around pH 4, which has been attributed as a probable manifestation of the Jones-Ray effect  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2073">2073</a><a name="r2073" id="r2073"></a>].

    <p>This property of saltwater enables a method for desalinating seawater  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2186">2186</a><a name="r2186" id="r2186"></a>]. A high surface area of many tiny bubbles can be produced in a bubble column evaporator (using a sintered glass gas entry) using seawater, but not in freshwater as then the bubbles coalesce. This allows the rapid production of water-saturated air that can then be condensed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Related to the coalescence behavior is the  electrical 
    conductivity of water that changes on degassing [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref43.html#r4347">4347</a><a name="r4347" id="r4347"></a>]. The  difference in electrical conductivity after degassing the solution is small but  reproducible, with the salts behaving similarly at concentration below 0.17 M.  However, the salts behave quite differently and specifically when their  concentration is 0.5 M.  The &alpha;&alpha; pairs show reproducible  lowering in the measured conductivity when degassed. However, The  &alpha;&beta; pairs show  a smaller increment in the measured  conductivity when degassed.</p>

    <p>The molar ionic volumes of salts, at infinite dilution,  depend on both the positive intrinsic volume of the ions and the negative volume change of the water due to the ion's electric field pulling on their neighboring water molecules. Their behavior with respect to temperature is thus mainly derived from how they can disrupt  the structuring in water (i.e., contract the clustering).

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="e" id="e"><sup>e </sup></a>The influence of pressure on the surface tension of water, as with other liquids, is not straightforward. There are two clear effects. Firstly, the thermodynamic relationship relating surface tension to pressure <img src="images/dgdp.gif" alt="Change in surface tension with pressure at constat temperature and surface area" width="59" height="47" align="middle" /> has been shown to equal the change in volume associated with forming a more extensive surface, <img src="images/stt12.gif" alt="(dV/dA)TPn" width="60" height="47" align="middle" />[<a href="ref13.html#r1283">1283</a><a name="r1283" id="r1283"></a>]. The expression <img src="images/stt14.gif" alt="(dA/dV)TPn" width="60" height="47" align="middle" /> may be taken as a measure of the difference in density of the liquid in the bulk compared with that  at its surface and is therefore generally positive (that is, the surface tension should increase with pressure about +0.7 mJ &#739; m<sup>&minus;2</sup> &#739; MPa<sup>&minus;1</sup> for water at 25&nbsp;&deg;C). The pressure coefficient of the surface tension (<img src="images/dvda.gif" alt="Change in surface tension with pressure=change in volume on change in surface area" width="145" height="47" align="middle" /> = <a   title="click to go" href="interfacial_water.html#c">surface enthalpy/internal+external pressure</a>, = 0.696 nm at 25&nbsp;&deg;C) is generally much higher than for other liquids; for example, methanol (0.159 nm), diethyl ether (0.176 nm), benzene (0.178 nm) and even mercury (0.398 nm) [<a href="ref13.html#r1280">1280</a>]. This high value for water indicates that the density at the surface of the water is more similar to the bulk liquid than occurs in most other liquids (see <a  title="click to go" href="interfacial_water.html#c">the thermodynamic derivatization</a>). Anomalously amongst liquids, the densities of surface and bulk water are equal at 3.984&nbsp;&deg;C (at atmospheric pressure, as calculated from the equations given in [<a href="ref13.html#r1280">1280</a>]). Below this temperature, the bulk liquid is less dense than the surface liquid. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>However, the thermodynamic relationship does not hold for real liquid-gas systems where  the application of pressure  will cause water vapor to condense and gas molecules to adsorb on to the liquid-gas interface. The adsorption of gas molecules to the surface of liquid water lowers the surface tension by a greater extent than the thermodynamic effect outlined above (except perhaps for helium). Thus, the surface tension of water, in contact with other molecules in the gas phase, drops with an increase in pressure due to the surface activity of surface-absorbed gas molecules [<a href="ref13.html#r1282">1282</a><a name="r1282" id="r1282"></a>]. The extent of this lowering depends upon the gas involved and is much greater for hydrophilic gases, such as CO<sub>2</sub> (-7.7 mJ &#739; m<sup>&minus;2</sup> &#739; MPa<sup>&minus;1</sup>), than nonpolar gases such as N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> (-0.8 mJ &#739; m<sup>&minus;2</sup> &#739; MPa<sup>&minus;1</sup>).

As the concentration of salt increases, the glass transition temperature increases, as does the disparity between the rotational and translational diffusivities. With the rotational diffusivity almost independent of the viscosity, this involves a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relationship  [<a href="ref15.html#r1451">1451</a><a name="r1451" id="r1451"></a>]. This is explained, like the explanation for the effect in deeply supercooled pure water, as sticky clusters (here, hydrated salt ions) continually jam into each other (thus high viscosity) but with intervening space where water molecules can rotate unimpeded.
