    <h2><a name="watis" id="watis"></a>What is homeopathy?</h2>
    <p>Homeopathy is a branch of alternative medicine,<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#b"> b</a><a name="bb" id="bb"></a>,<a title="click for an explanation" href="#i">i</a><a name="bi" id="bi"></a></sup> created in 1796 by the disillusioned doctor Samuel Hahnemann. It is based on the surmise that an individual may be treated using minute doses<sup><a name="bd" id="bd"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="#d">d</a></sup> of natural materials which in larger doses would be expected to cause the same symptoms (the 'like cures like' principle).<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#h"> h</a><a name="bh" id="bh"></a></sup> Remedies start with such a natural material that is  diluted and then subjected to a sequence of further dilutions in purified water or aqueous ethanol with considerable agitation (called succussion, see below) between dilution steps. Each dilution (as shown) results in about a 100-fold dilution, and many cycles (e.g., 20, 50, 200) are performed before the remedy is used.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#a"> a</a><a name="ba" id="ba">,</a><a title="click for an explanation" href="#g"> g</a><a name="bg" id="bg"></a></sup></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="images/succussion.gif" alt="Preparation of a homeopathic product by a sequence of dilutions"  title="Preparation of a homeopathic product by a sequence of dilutions" width="400" height="259" class="floatleft" />The initial popularity of homeopathy was partially due to the unhygienic crudeness of medical procedures in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, such as bloodletting. However, 200 years later, homeopathy is still gaining popularity, even if its efficacy is often disputed. The cornerstone of homeopathy that the whole clinical picture is considered, on an individual basis with generally lengthy consultations, is not in dispute. Consideration of the 'whole' person is  becoming more important as information concerning an individual's genome becomes clearer. However, criticism is leveled at homeopathic 'drugs', particularly as it appears to be 'just water'. Belief in whether or not dilution and shaking can have any 
      effect on the health benefits of water (for an overview of homeopathy see for example, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r484">484a</a><a name="r484" id="r484"></a>], for a review of homeopathy research see [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r484">484b</a>] and for a debate concerning homeopathy see [<a  href="ref14.html#r1363" name="r1363" title="go to cited reference" id="r1363">1363</a>]) 
      depends on the presence of an acceptable working hypothesis for the mode 
      of action (see also <a href="magnetic_electric_effects.html">magnetic effects</a>) of such shaken and overly diluted material. Indeed, a confounding aspect of examining  the efficacy of homeopathic treatments seems to be the highly variable nature of  supposedly similar homeopathic remedies from different manufacturing sources.&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>
    <h2><a name="pub" id="pub"></a>Published evidence</h2>
    <p>Despite many (most?) people knowing of success stories 
      (and the opposite) concerning the use of homeopathy where 
      it is practiced [<a  href="ref2.html#r120" name="r120" title="go to cited reference" id="r120">120</a>], 
      scientists have difficulty in regarding this form of alternative 
      medicine as any more than a <a href="http://skepdic.com/placebo.html" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin1" onclick="newWin('otherWin1')">placebo 
      effect</a>.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#e"> e</a><a name="be" id="be"></a></sup> Analysis of the literature has shown that there is little difference on average between the homeopathic effects and those of a placebo [<a name="r3743" id="r3743"></a><a href="ref38.html#r3743">3743</a>]. This, however, does not prove that the two effects are identical in any or all cases. The  &lsquo;<a href="memory_of_water.html">memory of water</a>&rsquo; is a  popular  phrase primarily associated  with homeopathy [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1211">1211</a><a name="r1211" id="r1211"></a>] following his and others&rsquo; allergy research work [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r132">132</a><a name="r132" id="r2"></a>]. These  research teams reported that solutes subjected to sequential physical processing and  dilution show biological effects different from those apparent using just  the water employed for the dilutions. The topic has drawn much controversy, with many 'scientists' siadly rejecting it outright without any study of the evidence; this 'confirmation bias' is a well-established phenomenon where evidence that supports pre-existing beliefs is readily accepted, whereas  evidence that undermines pre-existing beliefs is readily discarded. Whether or not this work is correctly interpreted, the value of homeopathy depends on whether it can treat ailments, not on whether water has '<a href="memory_of_water.html">memory</a>'.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Meta-analysis of 89 placebo-controlled trials failed to prove 
      either that homeopathy was efficacious for any single clinical 
      condition or that its positive clinical effects could entirely 
      be due to a placebo effect [<a  href="ref2.html#r121" name="r121" title="go to cited reference" id="r121">121a</a>], 
      thus leaving the scientific door open both ways. However, further 
      analysis of this data indicated that some of these 
      studies may have failed to avoid bias and that studies using 
      better methodology yielded the less favorable effects [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r121">121b</a>]. An analytical review has reinforced the more pessimistic 
      view concerning the clinical effectiveness of homeopathic 
      remedies [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r527">527</a><a name="r527" id="r527"></a>]. 
      Further, a  quality assessment of published experiments 
      on homeopathic preparations has concluded that many were performed 
      with inadequate controls [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r651">651</a><a name="r651" id="r651"></a>]. 
      Although a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2002/homeopathy.shtml" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin3" onclick="newWin('otherWin3')">scientific 
      trial of homeopathy conducted for the BBC</a> and similar work reported on ABC News' 20/20 program both failed to show 
      any homeopathic effect, the experiments they reported have been subject to <a href="https://homeopathic.com/two-e-mails-to-the-bbcs-producer-detailing-the-serious-errors-of-fact-in-their-program/" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin3" onclick="newWin('otherWin3')">severe criticism</a>, including that of <a href="https://homeopathic.com/e-mail-from-professor-ennis-on-the-specific-differences-in-her-study-and-the-studies-by-abc-news-2020-and-the-bbc/" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin4" onclick="newWin('otherWin4')"> careless scientific methodology</a> and <a href="https://homeopathic.com/the-protocol-used-by-the-bbcs-horizon-program-and-abcs-2020-program-in-their-tv-science-experiment/"  title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin42" onclick="newWin('otherWin42')">faulty protocols</a>. <img src="images/lancet.gif" alt="The Lancet Vol. 366 No 9487" width="240" height="303"  class="floatleft" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In August 2005 [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r840">840</a><a name="r840" id="r840"></a>], 
      the medical journal 'The Lancet'  controversially argued 
      for halting any further research into homeopathy, concluding 
      it has no effect other than as a placebo. This judgment 
      was based on its simultaneous publication of a comparative study of 110 matched placebo-controlled 
      trials of homeopathy and conventional medicine [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r841">841</a><a name="r841" id="r841"></a>]. However, the conclusion was reached despite the study showing   little evidence of differences between the two groups (homeopathy and   conventional) when all the data was considered.<img src="images/cherry_picked.gif" alt="cherry picking, from Benjamint444 " title="cherry picking, from Benjamint444 " width="120" height="146"  class="floatright"  /> There were differences when a   tiny percentage of unmatched more extensive trials were cherry-picked (unscientifically chosen as best fitting the prior hypothesis)) for further   analysis (that is, 102/110 of the homeopathy studies and 104/110 of the   conventional studies were discarded, even though these studies had been carefully chosen in the planning of the study using <em>a priori </em>inclusion and exclusion criteria).<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#c"> c</a><a name="bc" id="bc"></a></sup> The remaining 6% of the studies, however,   still showed positive (if not conclusive, possibly as the number of trials left   in this final grouping was so small and unmatched) evidence in favor of a homeopathic effect   over placebo. The more negative nature of the eight chosen homeopathy papers was mainly influenced by one single trial. Although Shang's study [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r841">841</a>] has come in for considerable and rightful criticism, and there is a strong case for its retraction, as above and [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref14.html#r1381">1381</a><a name="r1381" id="r1381"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref14.html#r1382">1382</a><a name="r1382" id="r1382"></a>,  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1524">1524</a><a name="r1524" id="r"></a>], it is often  put forward in support of the view that homeopathy works no better than as a placebo; a proposition that it does not deliver.&nbsp;Other journals play fast and loose with homeopathy research; for example, PLoSONE retracted, for no good reason, an original research article, published in 2016, which described the effects of homeopathic <em>Arnica montana</em> on interleukin-4 treated human macrophages [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3712">3712</a><a name="r3712" id="r3712"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There have been several quality studies that support the effectiveness of homeopathy. In one, thirty doctors at six clinical sites in four countries enrolled patients with acute respiratory problems.   281  patients were treated with homeopathy and 175  patients were treated with conventional  medicine, with mostly 5-15 minutes of consultation times. After 14 days, 83 % of the homeopathy-treated reported a positive response compared with 68% of the conventionally-treated, with 22% of conventionally-treated reporting adverse events compared with 8 % for the homeopathy-treated [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2450">2450</a><a name="r2450" id="r2450"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img src="images/swiss.jpg" width="160" height="240" class="floatright" title="Homeopathy in healthcare [2457]" alt="Homeopathy in healthcare [2457]" /></p>
   
    <p>An independent report commissioned by the Swiss health  authorities [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2457">2457</a><a name="r2457" id="r2457"></a>] concluded in 2011 &ldquo;<em>There is sufficient evidence for the  preclinical effectiveness and the clinical efficacy of homeopathy and for its  safety and economy compared with conventional treatment</em>&rdquo;. However, <a href="http://consultations.nhmrc.gov.au/files/consultations/drafts/resources/homeopathyoverviewreport140408.pdf"    title="opens new site in a pop-up window"    target="otherWin1" onclick="newWin('otherWin1')">a 2013 review</a> concluded that &ldquo;<em>There is a paucity of good - quality studies of sufficient size that examine the effectiveness of homeopathy as a treatment for any clinical condition in humans</em>&rdquo;. There remains questions over the clinical effectiveness of homeopathy with neither proof for nor proof against being conclusively proven. Nevertheless, a 2014 systematic review of randomized placebo-controlled trials of individualized homeopathic treatments concluded that they might have minor positive specific treatment effects [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2276">2276</a><a name="r2276" id="r2276"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Homeopathy is possibly effective in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Using a small study involving twenty children age 5-16  followed by ten 'controls' treated similarly but without the 'homeopathic substance', the intervention was associated with improvements in<br />
      criminality and anger [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2910">2910</a><a name="r2910" id="r2910"></a>]. It has been shown that ultra-highly diluted homeopathic remedies have demonstrable anti-viral effects [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3487">3487</a><a name="r3487" id="r3487"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some of the most convincing evidence promoted in favor of homeopathy has been its use with animals. It is challenging to propose how animal studies can show any placebo effect, especially if the study is double-blinded. For example, the  homeopathic preparation from the <em>Cocculus indicus</em> plant (cocc 30c) has been demonstrated, in a randomized double-blinded trial, to ameliorate the effects of sleep deprivation in rats [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2374">2374</a><a name="r2374" id="r2374"></a>]. However, systematic reviews of homeopathy used in veterinary conditions studied by randomized trials have been published with the conclusion that although there is some very limited evidence that such clinical intervention  is distinguishable from  placebo, evidence concerning the effective use of homeopathy in animals remains indecisive [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2447">2447</a><a name="r2447" id="r2447"></a>]. A comprehensive literature review of the peer-reviewed literature into the  efficacy of homeopathy in replacing   antibiotics in cattle, pigs, and poultry has been completed [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2826">2826</a><a name="r2826" id="r2826"></a>]. From 52 trials performed within 48 publications fulfilling the predefined criteria. Twenty-eight trials  favored homeopathy, with 26 trials showing a significantly higher efficacy in comparison to a control group, whereas 22 showed no therapeutic effect. Cure rates for the treatments with antibiotics, homeopathy, or placebo varied to a high degree. At the same time, the remedy used did not seem to make a big difference, with homeopathy being sometimes more effective than antimicrobials and sometimes <em>vice versa</em>. However, it was noted that no trial was repeated in a comparable manner,  so the efficacy of homeopathy remained unproven  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2216">2216</a><a name="r2216" id="r2216"></a>]. Although the use of homeopathic immunization  in Cuba against leptospirosis was not a controlled clinical study, the interventions occurred in response to an actual need to save lives. They were not randomized because the interventions were offered to all residents of the targeted communities. A total of 2.2 million residents were given two doses of a highly diluted preparation which gave a level of immunization comparable to that of the vaccine but at a much lower cost [<a name="r3747" id="r3747"></a><a href="ref38.html#r3747">3747</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>2018 claims to show that homeopathic treatment can ease pain in rats [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3442">3442</a><a name="r3442" id="r3442"></a>] are somewhat invalidated by the lack of care in the experimental procedures, the paper's poor preparation, and the small sample size [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3443">3443</a><a name="r3443" id="r3443"></a>]. The publication of such fault-ridden papers does not help the public's perceptions of homeopathy nor the science behind homeopathy.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    
    <p><a name="aus" id="aus"></a>The (Australian) National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has assessed the evidence of the effectiveness of homeopathy [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3282">3282a</a><a name="r3282" id="r3282"></a>] in a report that has subsequently been very influential in arguing against the effectiveness of homeopathy, particularly in America, France, Great Britain, and Australia.  This 'information paoer' was not published in a peer-reviewed journal but concluded that there are no health conditions for  reliable evidence that homeopathy is effective. However, the report was biased, and the authors cherry-picked the evidence used. <img src="images/cherry_picked.gif" alt="cherry picking, from Benjamint444 " title="cherry picking, from Benjamint444 " width="120" height="146"  class="floatright"  />Somewhat surprisingly, it had no homeopathic experts on their 'panel of experts' (in contrast to NHMRC's own guidelines) and was chaired by a member of an anti-homeopathy lobby group. This report has been subject to a commentary [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3282">3282b</a>], significant criticism [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3282">3282c</a>], and after a <a href="https://releasethefirstreport.com/the-full-story" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"    target="otherWin6" onclick="newWin('otherWin6')">worldwide campaign</a>, the Australian National Health &amp; Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has been forced to admit that it did the study twice and to release its original version (2012; The effectiveness of Homeopathy: An overview review of secondary science, prepared by the International Centre for Allied Health Evidence, University of South Australia; available in a subsequently annotated version <a href="https://www.hri-research.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Draft-annotated-2012-homeopathy-report.pdf"  title="opens new site in a pop-up window"    target="otherWin7" onclick="newWin('otherWin7')">here</a>). The&nbsp;existence of this report was never disclosed to the public<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>and the repressed knowledge of it being produced has only just (September 2019) been&nbsp;revealed through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. This 2012 report says that &quot;<strong>there is encouraging evidence for the effectiveness of homeopathy for</strong>&quot; several conditions. By subsequent  cherry-picking,  many original studies were excluded using latterly invented criteria  seemingly chosen and different from those originally planned, to unscientifically discount the many homeopathy-positive studies (&gt;97% of the chosen studies were discounted).    </p>

    <p>A bioassay for homeopathic solutions has been developed in a plant system (duckweed) that has shown itself to be reproducible in randomized, blinded trials [<a name="r3746" id="r3746"></a><a href="ref38.html#r3746">3746</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The <em>ad hominem</em> dismissal of homeopathy by many in the medical professions is promulgated by the off-hand attitude of the medical teaching staff without the time for a proper examination of the evidence. Indeed, the efforts to which studies have been repressed and altered to discount homeopathy seem  to be indications of a truth. The debate continues, with an excellent overview of this area  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2449">2449</a><a name="r2449" id="r2449"></a>], concluding '<em>Plausibility bias has introduced more heat than light into the debate around homeopathy: it has fired the debate without illuminating its information content.

    <p>Homeopathic solutions are not the same as pure water, nor are they the same as conventional dilutions. The homeopathic dilution/dynamization process causes the differences [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3710">3710</a><a name="r3710" id="r3710"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3711">3711</a><a name="r3711" id="r3711"></a>]. A thorough investigation into the structural differences previously 
      reported between homeopathically potentized (that is, succussed and extremely diluted) and unpotentized nitric acid 
      solutions showed that the effect was lost or changed if different glassware 
      was used [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r495">495</a><a name="r495" id="r495"></a>]. 
      Changes in the thermoluminescence of ice produced from ultra-diluted 
      water have been noted [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r500">500</a><a name="r500" id="r500"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r500"> a</a>]. However, they can be explained by remaining trace amounts of material 
      (due to poor mixing, impurities, absorption, <a  title="go for more information"  href="nanobubble.html">nanobubbles</a> (that is, nanocavities) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r500">500d</a>] or other causes) 
      being concentrated between ice crystals [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r500">500b</a>]; 
      an explanation supported by later work [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r500">500c</a>]. A series of  papers from Academician Konovalov has proposed that physical and biological effects of highly diluted aqueous solutions differ from those expected from simple dilution and may be due to the formation of nano-sized (up to 400 nm) molecular assemblies  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2207">2207</a><a name="r2207" id="r2207"></a>]. There is also the possibility that more diluted samples may be more active due to different hydration statuses [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3707">3707</a><a name="r3707" id="r3707"></a>]. <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#k"> k</a><a name="bk" id="bk"></a></sup> Also, maxima in the biological activity at very dilute concentrations (&asymp;  10<sup>&minus;15</sup> - 10<sup>&minus;18</sup> M), below measurable concentrations, have been widely reported [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2232">2232</a><a name="r2232" id="r2232"></a>]. It has been shown that surface-active nanoparticles may be formed during the early succussion/dilution steps. As they concentrate in the solution-air interface, they are not diluted as expected. They may still be present in solutions even diluted by factors of 10<sup>400</sup>, far greater than the Avogadro limit (10<sup>23</sup>)  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2375">2375</a><a name="r2375" id="r2375"></a>]. Thus it is probable that nanoparticles remain in homeopathic dilutions and possible that even such low concentrations have biological effects.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Changes in the NMR relaxation times [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1620">1620a</a><a name="r1620" id="r1620"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1620">1620c</a>], thermochemistry [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1644">1644</a><a name="r1644" id="r1644"></a>], and  UV absorption [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1620">1620b</a>] of water have been reported in some homeopathic preparations.  There is now evidence from (blinded) NMR of a definite memory effect upon dilution/potentization of different substances (water, lactose, copper, gelsemium) as determined by <sup>1</sup> H spin-lattice T<sub>1</sub> and spin-spin T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time and average H/H distances [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3055">3055</a><a name="r3055" id="r3055"></a>]. These experiments showed a considerable slowing down of molecular movements around water molecules up to a distance of 0.37 nm. This reinforced the evidence that homeopathic solutions cannot be considered  pure water  and  there is a definite memory effect upon potentization.</p>

Comparable dyes lacking charge transfer  are unaffected by homeopathic potencies, suggesting potencies require the oscillating dipole of solvatochromic dyes for effective interaction [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2911">2911</a><a name="r2911" id="r2911"></a>].</p>

    <p>A key feature of any difference 
      between water before and after its use in preparing homeopathic 
      dilutions is likely to be the vigorous shaking (succussion) 
      that must be carried out between successive dilutions. This may produce  significantly increased  
      silicate, sodium and bicarbonate ions [<a  href="ref4.html#r335" name="r335" title="go to cited reference" id="r335">335</a>, <a name="r1207" id="r1207"></a><a href="ref13.html#r1207">1207</a>]

The amount of succussion has been proven to have a significant influence on treatment effectiveness [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2983">2983</a><a name="r2983" id="r2983"></a>]. Nanobubbles may be insignificant due to their extremely high surface area/volume ratio. It is well known that organic molecules prefer to lie at aqueous interfaces [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1889">1889</a><a name="r1889" id="r1889"></a>], allowing such solutions to absorb significant amounts of organics from the laboratory atmosphere. Indeed, there is now a body of evidence that diluted salt solutions containing  nanobubbles, formed by vigorous stirring, can have clinical effects on immunological diseases  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2002">2002</a><a name="r2002" id="r2002"></a>] and can promote growth in plants [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2014">2014</a><a name="r2014" id="r2014"></a>] and animals [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2015">2015</a><a name="r2015" id="r2015"></a>]. Some molecules (e.g., detergents) preferentially partition at interfaces by many orders of magnitude. A paper from Nobel prize-winning Luc Montagnier has declared that quite dilute solutions (of DNA) show entirely different properties from the less diluted solutions.

    <h2><a name="conc" id="conc"></a>Does homeopathy work?</h2>
    <p> Many ridicule homeopathy out of serious consideration as clinical practice, sometimes resorting to unscientific, unbalanced, and unrefereed editorial diatribe.  One of 
      the main reasons concerning this disbelief in the efficacy 
      of homeopathy lies in  difficulty in understanding how 
      it might work  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2065">2065</a><a name="r2065" id="r2065"></a>]. If an acceptable theory were available, then 
      more people would consider it more seriously. However, it 
      is difficult, at present, to sustain an argument as to why a truly 
      infinitely diluted aqueous solution, consisting of just H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, should retain any difference 
      from any other such solution. It is even more challenging to 
      put forward a working hypothesis about how small quantities 
      of such 'solutions' can elicit a specific response when confronted with large amounts 
      of complex solutions in a patient. A significant problem in this area is that, without a testable hypothesis 
      for the generally acknowledged potency of homeopathy (except, perhaps, flawed dilution assumptions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2375">2375</a>]), there 
      is a growing possibility of others making fraudulent claims 
      in related areas. Perhaps this is evidenced by the increasing use 
      of the internet to advertise 'healthy' water concentrates 
      using dubious (sometimes published but irreproducible) scientific 
      and spiritual evidence.&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>

    <p><a name="b" id="b"></a><sup>b</sup> Homeopathy is one of many historical health-care practices  like traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, yoga, faith healing, chiropractic manipulation, aromatherapy, massage, hypnotherapy,  and folk medicines such as ginseng. Although there is much testimonial evidence supporting the efficacy of each of these practices, they all remain contentious due to a lack of sufficient scientifically rigorous proof.

This analysis suffered from HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known) (N. L. Kerr, HARKing: Hypothesizing After the Results are Known. <em>Personality and Social Psychology Review</em>, <strong>2</strong> (1998) 196-217). The study does not appear to have used a pre-determined rationale, or pre-determined parameters, in  discarding trials. It completes no sensitivity analysis and ends up 'dredging' the data in an unbalanced manner to falsify the conclusions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1524">1524</a>]. Further analysis of the data, provided post-publication, shows that the conclusions would have been different for almost all alternative cut-off points [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1524">1524</a>]; that is, they would <strong>not support the conclusions</strong> that homeopathy is no more than a placebo effect or that homeopathy trials are less competent than conventional trials.

    <p><a name="d" id="d"></a><sup>d</sup> This 'dilution'  is usually so extreme  that no molecules of the starting material are expected to be found in the final 'solution'.

    <p><a name="e" id="e"></a><sup>e</sup> <strong>The placebo effect</strong>. A&nbsp;placebo&nbsp;is an inert substance or treatment which is designed to have no therapeutic value. However, after taking such a placebo in place of  medication, the belief that one has taken the medication itself can produce some of its effects. The placebo effect in drug trials has been reviewed [<a name="r3744" id="r3744"></a><a href="ref38.html#r3744">3744</a>]. It should  be noted that placebo (from the Latin 'I will do good') effects constitute real clinical effects [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r121">121c</a>] even though they contain just <img src="images/placebo.gif"  alt="Placebo tablets" title="Placebo tablets" width="112" height="296" class="floatright" />filler, such as lactose, and no active ingredients. They are widely used as control medication in medical trials. Placebos should  be judged positively and probably account for a significant proportion of the success of prevailing established medicine [<a name="r1474" id="r1474"></a><a href="ref15.html#r1474">1474</a>]. They may act primarily by relieving anxiety. Curiously,  placebos have a greater effect  in trials that do not inform patients about the possible placebo intervention unless the placebo is presented in a positive manner. The cheerfulness and interest of the doctor in the patient also increase the placebo's effectiveness. Additionally, there must be a range of 'placebo effects' of different potencies and having different effects in different situations. As such, they surely overlap with actual clinical effects. For example, it seems clear that antidepressant medications used for many years are not efficacious. Any perceived difference from placebo is due to the reduced responsiveness to placebo in the severely depressed [<a name="r1455" id="r1455"></a><a href="ref15.html#r1455">1455</a>]. Placebos work in certain situations. It has been shown in a randomized-controlled trial that open-label placebos reduce test anxiety and improve self-management skills [<a name="r3748" id="r3748"></a><a href="ref38.html#r3748">3748</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Placebos are used in clinical trials where the object is to minimize their effect relative to the therapeutic agent. However, when the therapeutic agent is subsequently used, the object is to maximize any additional placebo effect. This introduces some conflict.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Many modern medications have no effect on most people; for example, statins, commonly used to lower cholesterol, benefit only 1 in 50, and esomeprazole only benefits 1 in 25 heartburn sufferers. Antidepressants are reported to act through a placebo effect rather than containing active ingredients [<a href="ref38.html#r3744">3744</a>]. It seems strange to this writer that so many of those who dispute homeopathy's efficacy saying, without proof, that they believe there is nothing there, are quite happy to accept that there exists a 'placebo' effect where it is known absolutely that there is nothing there.
