    All systems may retain a memory of their previous treatment, whether this is due to the formation of stable contamination or  the production of energetic heterogeneities. It has been shown that the physical properties not only depend on the initial temperature but also on kurtosis [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3112">3112</a><a name="r3112" id="r3112"></a>]; the distribution of the particles' kinetic energies from the mean value, a property that may depend on its history. It should not be surprising that water also may retain a memory of its history.

   <p><a name="benven" id="benven"></a>The  &lsquo;memory of water&rsquo; is a  popular  phrase that is mainly associated  with <a title="go fore more information" href="homeopathy.html">homeopathy</a> and the charismatic Jacques Benveniste (see left) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1211">1211</a><a name="r1211" id="r1211"></a>] following his and others&rsquo; allergy research work [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r132">132</a><a name="r132" id="r132"></a>]. Benveniste was a leading French  immunologist who headed a large <abbr title="Institut national de la sant&eacute; et de la recherche m&eacute;dicale (French Institute of Health and Medical Research)">INSERM</abbr> laboratory directed at immunology, allergy, and inflammation research. <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="memory_of_water.html#j">j</a><a name="bj" id="bj"></a>  </sup>He reported that when white blood cells with a   particular substance on their surfaces are exposed to a particular  antibody,   they release histamine in a manner that can be visibly monitored   using a microscope. This work generated a controversial but 'in good faith' paper reviewed and published by 
      Nature [<a  href="ref2.html#r132" title="go to cited reference" id="">132</a>] after referees could find no flaws with the experimental procedure, and they had held up publication for two years while awaiting independent confirmation from impartial laboratories in Israel, Italy, and Canada. These  research teams reported that even if the amount of that antibody was subjected to sequential physical processing and  was apparently diluted many   billions of times until there was essentially none left, it still had   an observable biological effect different from those apparent using just  the water employed for the dilutions (the '<a href="memory_of_water.html">memory of 
      water</a>' [<a href="ref12.html#r1112" name="r1112" title="go to cited reference" id="r1112">1112</a>])<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="memory_of_water.html#a"> a</a><a name="ba" id="ba"></a></sup>. The subject has drawn much controversy, with many 'scientists' simply rejecting it outright without studying the evidence. Also, it has 
      not been more generally accepted after Nature reported the results as not 
      reproducible by Nature's self-acknowledged biased observers (the Editor of Nature, a magician (!) and a malpractice investigator, none of whom had any relevant scientific experience).<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="memory_of_water.html#k"> k</a><a name="bk" id="bk"></a> </sup> and under oppressive, 
      overly-demanding (with over twice the previous weekly load of tests) and unsympathetic conditions, in a limited and rushed 5-day trial (of five years and five laboratories work) using poorly responsive basophils, and with  negative results from only the one laboratory being cherry-picked from amongst otherwise positive results [<a  href="ref2.html#r133" name="r133" title="go to cited reference" id="r133">133</a>]. 
      The original results [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r132">132</a>] were, 
      however, confirmed in a blinded study by the statistician Alfred Spira [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref4.html#r346">346e</a>] and also in a rather bizarre Nature paper purporting 
      to prove the opposite  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref4.html#r346">346b</a>], <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="memory_of_water.html#i">i</a><a name="bi" id="bi"></a></sup> They were subsequently comprehensively confirmed by a blinded 
      multi-center trial [<a  href="ref4.html#r346" name="r346" title="go to cited reference" id="r346">346a</a>], and new results confirm similar phenomena [<a  href="ref16.html#r1585" name="r1585" title="go to cited reference" id="r1585">1585</a>]. Despite this apparent confirmation by these several laboratories, there are still doubts (expressed by some) over whether the experiments are genuinely   reproducible and whether the noted effects may be due to the origin of the biological samples or human operator effects  [<a  href="ref14.html#r1362" name="r1362" title="go to cited reference" id="r1362">1362</a>]. Further support for an effect has been found using NMR [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1552">1552</a><a name="r1552" id="r1552"></a>]. It is important to note that even if Benveniste's experiments were simply false positives, no conclusions could be drawn over the efficacy of homeopathy. Many negligent critics of homeopathy have ignored this logic.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The 'Memory of water' area was the subject of several peer-reviewed papers in the journal <strong>Homeopathy </strong>(July 2007),<sup><a title="click for more information" href="memory_of_water.html#c"> c</a><a name="bc" id="bc"></a></sup> and the field has been over-viewed [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1206">1206</a><a name="r1206" id="r1206"></a>]. Although there is much support for water  showing properties that depend on its prior processing (that is, water having a memory effect), the experimental evidence indicates that such changes are due primarily to solute and surface changes occurring during this processing. The empirical evidence for specific changes in the physicochemical properties of homeopathic preparations&nbsp; has been reviewed, concluding that there is evidence for specific physicochemical changes in the homeopathic preparations  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3711">3711</a><a name="r3711" id="r3711"></a>]. Indeed, simply stirring a solution may have pronounced effects on the vessel's surface charge and chemistry, which can last for several minutes after the stirring has ceased [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2138">2138</a><a name="r2138" id="r2138"></a>]. Another memory scenario concerns individual O:H&ndash;O hydrogen bond possessing memory of their physical temperature and pressure history that lasts  minutes [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2227">2227</a><a name="r2227" id="r2227"></a>]. This hypothesis, although well-published in peer-reviewed journals, needs further substantiation. There is evidence from (blinded) NMR of a clear memory effect upon dilution/potentization of different substances (water, lactose, copper, gelsemium) as determined by <sup>1</sup> H spin-lattice T<sub>1</sub> and spin-spin T<sub>2</sub> relaxation time and average H/H distances [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3055">3055</a><a name="r3055" id="r3055"></a>]. The experimentally corroborated memory phenomena cannot be taken as supporting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy"  title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin11" onclick="newWin('otherWin11')">basic tenets of homeopathy,</a> although they can  explain some effects [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1206">1206</a>].&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="memory_of_water.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>] </p>
    <h2><a name="spec" id="spec"></a>Is water special?</h2>
    <p>The primary evidence against water having a memory is  the very short (&asymp; ps) lifetime of <a  title="go for more details"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen bonds</a> between the water molecules [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1209">1209</a><a name="r1209" id="r1209"></a>]. Indeed, in the  absence of other materials or surfaces (see later), the specific hydrogen  bonding pattern surrounding a solute does not persist when the solute is  removed any more than would a cluster around any specified water molecule, or else water would not know which of its myriad past solutes took preference. Indeed the atoms that make up the water molecule only remain together for about a millisecond  in liquid water due to proton exchange (see <a  title="go for an explanation" href="water_dissociation.html">water dissociation</a>). An NMR study shows no stable 
      (&gt;1 ms, &gt;5 &mu;M) water clusters 
      are found in homeopathic preparations [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r712">712</a><a name="r712" id="r712"></a>]. It should, however, be noted that the <a title="go to see cartoon explanation" href="clusters_overview.html#mem">lifetime of hydrogen bonds does not control the lifetime of clusters</a> in the same way that a sea wave may cross an ocean, remaining as a wave and with dependence on its  history, but with its molecular content continuously changing.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="memory_of_water.html#g"> a</a><a name="bg" id="bg"></a></sup> Also, the equilibrium concentrations of any clusters are governed by thermodynamics, not kinetics. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Microwave irradiation gives rise to a memory effect on the surface tension of water that lasts for minutes after the effect of temperature rise alone has ended [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2208">2208</a><a name="r2208" id="r2208"></a>]. An extraordinary paper authored by Nobel prize-winning Luc Montagnier has described memory effects in aqueous DNA solutions that the authors propose depend on interactions with the background electromagnetic field. These effects, if confirmed,  require the prior processing and dilution of the solutions and are explained by Montagnier as resonance phenomena with nanostructures derived from the DNA and water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1602">1602</a><a name="r1602" id="r1602"></a>].<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="memory_of_water.html#e"> e</a><a name="be" id="be"></a></sup></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As  applied to homeopathy, the 'memory of water' concept should also be extended to  the memory of aqueous ethanol preparations, which are also used. The addition of ethanol to water adds  an further  critical area of complexity. Ethanol forms solutions in water that  are far from ideal and very slow to equilibrate  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1212">1212</a><a name="r1212" id="r1212"></a>]. Although usually  considered a single phase, such solutions may contain several distinct phases [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1297">1297</a><a name="r1297" id="r1297"></a>], and more generally  consist of a complex mixture dominated  by water-water and ethanol-ethanol clusters, where hydrogen-bonding is  longer-lived than in water alone [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1213">1213</a><a name="r1213" id="r1213"></a>]. They also favor nanobubble (that is, nanocavity) formation [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1172">1172</a><a name="r1172" id="r1172"></a>].  Thus, the peculiar behavior of aqueous solutions (as mostly discussed on this  page) is accentuated by the presence of ethanol.&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="memory_of_water.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>
    <h2><a name="glas" id="glas"></a>Does the glassware matter? </h2>
    <p>The process of silica dissolution has been much studied [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1109">1109</a><a name="r1109" id="r1109"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1207">1207</a><a name="r1207" id="r1207"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2018">2018</a><a name="r2018" id="r2018"></a>] (ultrapure water can pick up 0.2 <a href="constants.html#ppb">ppb</a> Na<sup>+</sup> ion from glassware in just one day), ever since it was proven by Lavoisier about 250 years ago, and fits with this argument. This may explain why glass is preferred over 
      polypropylene tubes in homeopathic preparations. It should be noted that dissolved silica 
      is capable of forming solid particles with complementary structures 
      (that is, imprints) to dissolved solutes and macromolecules, 
      and such particles will 'remember' these complementary structures 
      essentially forever. Such chemistry is expected to be preferred at aqueous-air interfaces due to the simultaneous reduction in charge density.  It is worth noting that contact with water may change glass surfaces irreversibly  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1882">1882</a><a name="r1882" id="r1882"></a>], clearly a 'memory' effect. &nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="memory_of_water.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>] </p>
    <h2><a name="gas" id="gas"></a>Is gas important?</h2>
    <p>Water does store and transmit information 
      concerning solutes through its hydrogen-bonded network. 
      Changes to this clustering network brought about by solutes 
      may take some time to re-equilibrate. Agitation (succussion) may also affect  the hydrogen-bonded network (shear encouraging 
      destructuring). The gaseous solutes (with critical effect 
      on structuring [<a  href="ref3.html#r294" name="r294" title="go to cited reference" id="r294">294</a>] 
      and possible significant production of structuring <a  title="go for more information"  href="nanobubble.html">nanobubbles</a> (nanocavities) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r993">993</a><a name="r993" id="r993"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1552">1552</a>]) may well contribute to  the altered heats of dilution with such materials [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1143">1143</a><a name="r1143" id="r1143"></a>]. The content of gases in water strongly depends on  its prior treatment, and a disturbed equilibrium restores relatively slowly. Mechanically induced hydrogen bond breakage may also give rise to increased (but low) hydrogen peroxide formation [<a name="r1066" id="r1066"></a><a href="ref11.html#r1066">1066</a> see <a href="memory_of_water.html#vibr">equations</a> below], and such effects have been reported 
      to last for weeks [<a  href="ref4.html#r336" name="r336" title="go to cited reference" id="r336">336</a>]. It may be relevant to note that  hydrogen peroxide can take part in and catalyze further reactions with other reactive species such as molecular oxygen and dissolved ozone [<a href="ref11.html#r1066">1066</a>,<a  title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1069"> 1069</a><a name="r1069" id="r1069"></a>, <a name="r1751" id="r1751"></a><a href="ref18.html#r1751">1751</a>]. Hydrogen peroxide is not often recognized but is present in nanomolar amounts and may vary with the number of succussion steps and their sequence. This may explain the changes in the efficacy of homeopathic preparations with the number of dilutions    [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1210">1210</a><a name="r1210" id="r1210"></a>].

    <h2><a name="dil" id="dil"></a>Does dilution happen as predicted?</h2>
    <p>Dilution is never perfect, particularly at low concentrations 
      where surface absorption may well be a significant factor, so that 
      dilution beyond the levels that can be analytically determined 
      remains unproven. The remaining material may be responsible for 
      perceived differences between preparations and activity. Of 
      course, the water used for dilution is not pure relative to 
      the putative concentration of the 'active' ingredient; even 
      the <a href="http://www.millipore.com/references/files/pmc_url/$file/RD002.pdf" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin2" onclick="newWin('otherWin2')">purest 
      water should be considered grossly contaminated</a> compared 
      with the theoretical homeopathic dilution levels. This contamination 
      may well have a major influence and be influenced 
      by the structuring in the water it encounters. Although it 
      does, at first sight, seem unlikely that solutes in diluted 
      'homeopathic' water should be significantly different from 
      a proper aqueous control, it has  been cogently argued 
      that the concentrations of impurities can change during the 
      dilution process by reactions initiated by the original 'active' 
      material [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r531">531</a><a name="r531" id="r531"></a>]. This process has been mathematically modeled [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1210">1210</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A further consideration about 'the memory of water' is that the 
      popular understanding concerning how homeopathic preparations may 
      work not only requires this memory but also requires that this memory 
      becomes amplified during the dilution; this amplification, necessitated 
      by the increase in efficacy with extensive dilution, being even 
      harder to explain. Samal and Geckeler have published an interesting, 
      if controversial, paper [<a  href="ref3.html#r272" name="r272" title="go to cited reference" id="r272">272a</a> but see <a  href="ref3.html#r272"  title="go to cited reference">272b</a>] concerning the effect of dilution on some molecules. They found 
      that some molecules gather in larger clusters on dilution rather than 
      the smaller clusters thermodynamically expected. Just the presence 
      of one such sizeable &mu;m-sized particle in 
      the 'diluted' solution could give rise to the noticed biological 
      action (of course, some such preparations may be  without 
      any action, being without such clustered particles).<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="memory_of_water.html#a"> a</a></sup></p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>However, it remains to explain this particular phenomenon, which appears to disobey 
      the second law of thermodynamics. <a name="hypo" id="hypo"></a>A possible explanation is that 
      such biologically active molecules can cooperatively form icosahedral 
      expanded water networks (<abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a>) </abbr>to surround and screen them by forming face-linked 
      icosahedra, similar to as expected in the minimal energy-related 
      poly-tetrahedral Dzugutov clusters [<a  href="ref3.html#r295" name="r295" title="go to cited reference" id="r295">295</a>]. 
      So long as such an icosahedral network structure requires the help 
      of more than one neighboring such cluster to stabilize its formation 
      then, in more concentrated solution, the molecules dissolve normally. 
      However, as they are diluted (typically beyond about one clathrate-forming 
      group per twelve <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">icosahedral water clusters</a>; 
      3,360 water molecules) no neighboring such clusters are available. The clusters coalesce to form larger clusters of biologically-active 
      molecules within their own <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a>-related</abbr> water network (so releasing some of the water). </p>

    <p><a name="dilution" id="dilution"></a>This tendency for 
      particle formation is ultimately due to the hydrophobic effect and 
      the tendency to form a small surface with the water. Overall the

      and particle cluster stabilization. Such, or similar, particles have been shown to  prefer  the surface of &nbsp;the solution with this interfacial concentration preserved (see also [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3609">3609</a><a name="r3609" id="r3609"></a>] ).

    <h2><a name="comp" id="comp"></a>Solutions are more complex than expected</h2>
    <p>Water is not just H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. It contains a multitude of molecular  species including <a href="ortho_para_water.html"><em>ortho</em><em>-</em>water and <em>para-</em>water molecules</a>, water molecules with  different isotopic compositions such as HDO and H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O, such water molecules as part of weakly-bound but partially-covalently  linked <a href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html">molecular clusters</a> containing one, two, three, or four hydrogen  bonds, and <a href="water_dissociation.html">hydrogen ion and hydroxide ion</a> species. Apart from such molecules,  there are always adventitious and self-created solutes in liquid water. Perhaps surprisingly, distilled  and deionized waters contain significant and varying quantities of  contaminating ions. Often the criteria for &lsquo;purity&rsquo; is the conductivity, but  this will not show ionic contaminants at nanomolar, or even somewhat higher, concentrations  due to the relatively high conductivity of the H<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&minus;</sup> ions naturally present.

Liquid water is  a complex system even before  the further complexity of molecular clusters, gas-liquid and solid-liquid  surfaces, reactions between these materials, the consequences of physical  and electromagnetic processing, and the addition of ethanol are considered. Any or a combination of these factors may cause 'memory' of past solutes and processing in water. Some of these solutions are capable of causing non-specific clinical effects, whereas others may cause effects linked specifically to the solution's (and laboratory) history, as outlined below [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1206">1206</a>]. Both temperature and magnetic fields affect the infrared spectrum of water (showing their effect on water clustering), and these effects remain for a considerable time (&asymp; 1 hour) after the magnetic field is removed or temperature changed [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1697">1697</a><a name="r1697" id="r1697"></a>].

    <p>The micrometer-sized water droplets (microdroplets) formed during succussion may cause the spontaneous reduction of organic molecules, so producing permanent changes to the solution (a clear memory effect)  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3653">3653</a><a name="r3653" id="r3653"></a>]. The presence of such active oxygen species and gases or their mixtures in water may 
      have significant and long-term 'memory' effects by reacting with  extraneous solutes and initiating chain reactions. Some products are relatively   stable, and they can certainly be determined after stirring.&nbsp;It has been shown that the air-water surface, of itself, cannot produce peroxide in the absence of atmospheric ozone  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref45.html#r4490">4490</a><a name="r4490" id="r4490"></a>].</p>

    <p><a name="a" id="a"></a><sup>a</sup> A related phenomenon may be 
      the occurrence of conductivity oscillations (&asymp;  0.5 Hz) at

    <p><a name="b" id="b"></a><sup>b</sup> This example of  &lsquo;pH memory&lsquo; was later explained briefly as the enzymes' acidic and basic groups retaining their charge when in an anhydrous environment [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1208">1208</a>]. This explanation is accepted but remains unproven independently and is derived from a circular argument that does not inform on how the charge is retained. There remains some puzzle  to the extent that a single group in a molecule can either be charged or  not charged; it cannot be fractionally charged. Thus the enzyme might be expected to behave as containing a mixture of charged and uncharged groups rather than, as found, fractionally charged groups as in the hydrated enzyme (two easily distinguished scenarios). Perhaps there is sufficient hydration water retained to ensure this, but this author does not believe that this has been shown. Whatever, the &lsquo;puzzle&rsquo; of the enzyme&rsquo;s memory will disappear with  an acceptable explanation.                    Later work has shown that freeze-drying may cause a significant change in the extent of protonation of pH indicators [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2986">2986</a><a name="r2986" id="r2986"></a>], with the final pH depending on the water remaining. Also, the acidity may change considerably during the freezing process even if the final pH of the freeze-dried material is close to its initial state [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2987">2987</a><a name="r2987" id="r2987"></a>].

    <p><a name="g" id="g"></a><sup>g</sup> The Nobel-prize-winning physicist Brian Josephson has reinforced the argument that the speed at which things happen at the <em>microscopic</em> level (e.g., the level of molecules) cannot be equated with the lifetime of the <em>macroscopic</em> system involved with the  illustration of the superconducting state.  This state can have a very   long lifetime (with 'persistent currents' in superconducting   rings, which have been found to persist for years), but the 'turnover   rate' in terms of how long the constituent electrons stay in any given   state before being scattered is extremely short.

    <p><sup>i</sup><a name="i" id="i" ></a> This paper was bizarre because its data showed a positive effect (therefore actually supporting the 'memory of water'  conclusions). The Authors dismissed these positive conclusions  out of hand as 'a source of error for which we cannot account', so leaving the remaining data (that is, only the data which agreed with their headline disproof). It should  be noted that the statistical report upon which this paper was based states that ' <em>One interpretation is that there are, after all, differences between the treatments...</em>' [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref4.html#r346">346c</a>], but this statement does not survive  into the final version published by the journal 'Nature'. The Authors have refused to release their raw data [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref4.html#r346">346d</a>] for  unbiased statistical analysis. Nature also   published 
      a paper on 'ultrafast memory loss' in water that, perhaps 
      ingenuously, appears to misinterpret this 'memory of water' 
      concept, as it only concerns the 'memory' of single water 
      molecules, not clusters or larger amounts of water molecules [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r750">750</a><a name="r750" id="r750"></a>]. Overall the episode reflects badly on the otherwise respected journal 'Nature'.

For the last 14 years of his life, he  championed not only 'the memory of water' but also an even more controversial theory that 'information can   be transmitted over telephone lines.

    <p><a name="k" id="k"></a><sup>k</sup> Although the Editor of Nature (Maddox) initially stated that the investigation into the data would be by 'independent investigators' it was heavily biased, including and  led by Maddox himself, who had already stated that he did not believe the data, '<em>There is no physical basis for such an activity</em>' and &quot;<em>A journal really has to have an opinion</em>&quot;. The  magician Maddox chose to help his 'investigation' was James Randi (&ldquo;The Amazing  Randi&rdquo;), well-known for his skeptical views concerning complementary medicine.  He later made his living from these, having retired from 'magic'. The third investigator was Walter Stewart, a zealot dedicated  to uncovering scientific fraud. It was Stewart who found MIT biologist Thereza Imanishi-Kari guilty on 19 charges of research misconduct, only for all these charges to be overturned eight years later by an appeals panel of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (D. Kevles, <em>The Baltimore Case: A Trial of Science, Politics, and Character </em>(W. W. Norton &amp; Co., New York, 1998)).  Stewart was later described as evil by Kevles as determined to find and prove scientific fraud  at any cost as a vindication of his  belief  that fraud is rampant in the scientific community. Maddox had exaggerated zealotry for disproving the data and so was certainly not independent. Maddox stated '<em>None of us has first-hand experience in the field of work at INSERM 200</em>'. Maybe, he did not wish to risk whether a genuinely independent review by  experts would come up with the result he required.
