    <h2><a name="clu" id="clu"></a>Water clustering</h2>
    <p>Life on Earth depends on the unusual structure 
      and <a href="water_anomalies.html">anomalous nature of liquid water</a>. 
      Organisms consist mainly of liquid water. This water performs many 
      functions, and it can never be considered merely as an inert diluent; 
      it transports, lubricates, reacts, stabilizes, signals, structures, 
      and partitions. The living world should be thought of as an equal 
    partnership between  biological molecules and water. Both short-range (&lt; 1nm) and long-range (&gt; 100 nm)   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2268">2268</a><a name="r2268" id="r2268"></a>] organization of the water molecules has been detected.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Despite much work, many of the properties of water are 
      puzzling. Enlightenment comes from an understanding that water 
      molecules form an infinite dynamic hydrogen-bonded network with localized 
      and structured clustering [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1866">1866</a><a name="r1866" id="r1866"></a>]. The middling strength of the connecting 
      hydrogen bonds seems ideally suited to life processes, being 
      easily formed but not too difficult to break. An important 
      concept, often overlooked, is that although  liquid water appears homogeneous at macroscopic length scales and time scales, it is not homogeneous 
      at the nanoscopic time or length scales (<em>e.g., </em>see [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r993">993</a><a name="r993" id="r993"></a>]). Two processes drive the structuring of liquid water; an <a href="thermodynamics.html#H">enthalpic process </a>that maximizes the number and strength of the hydrogen bonds towards an optimum of four strong bonds on each water molecule, and an <a href="thermodynamics.html#S">entropic process</a> that maximizes the rotational freedom and translational independence of the water molecules. Working at a picosecond timescale, these two processes compete against each other, dependent on the temperature and pressure. A greater number of strong hydrogen bonds reduce the entropy and a greater freedom of movement (entropy) reduces the number and strength (enthalpy) of the hydrogen bonds. These processes are finely balanced, and there are many ways by which the same minimum energy may be achieved.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Small clusters of four water molecules (<strong>A</strong>) may 
      come together to form water bicyclo-octamers (<strong>B</strong>) with higher negative enthalpy (more strong bonds) but lower entropy (more ordered). (<strong>A</strong>) occurs in high-density <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_vii.html">ice-seven</a> whereas, with 60&deg; 
      relative twist, (<strong>B</strong>) is found in low-density <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html"> hexagonal ice</a>; (<a href="water_equilibria.html">see 
      the animated gif, 129 kB</a>). Structures similar to <strong>A</strong> have higher numbers of 3-hydrogen-bonded and 5-coordinated water molecules as found at warmer temperatures in liquid water. In contrast, structures similar to <strong>B</strong> have higher numbers of 4-hydrogen-bonded and 4-coordinated water molecules as found at colder temperatures in liquid water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1773">1773</a><a name="r1773" id="r1773"></a>]. Such equilibria are balanced 
      due to the existence of two minima in the potential energy 
      (U) - molecular separation (r) diagram below, which shows 
      the approach of the water tetramers. High energy x-ray diffraction experiments show that the number of water nearest neighbors does not vary over the range 254.2 &ndash; 365.9 K, with neighboring molecules switching between strong hydrogen-bonded and weak or non-hydrogen-bonded  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2273">2273</a><a name="r2273" id="r2273"></a>], in agreement with this model.</p>

     <p> This competition between maximizing van-der Waals interactions 
      (<strong>A</strong>, generating higher orientation entropy, 
      higher density, and individually weaker but more numerous water-water 
      binding energies) and maximizing hydrogen bonding (<strong>B</strong>, 
      yielding more ordered structuring, lower density, and fewer 
      but stronger water-water binding energies) is finely balanced, 
      and easily shifted with changed physical conditions, solutes, and 
      surfaces. The potential energy barrier between these states 
      (see below left) ensures that water molecules prefer either 
      structure <strong>A</strong> or <strong>B</strong> with little 
      time spent on intermediate structures. An individual water 
      molecule may be in state <strong>A</strong> concerning 
      some neighbors while being in state <strong>B</strong> concerning 
       others (for example, <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_vii.html">ice-seven</a>). It is expected that higher-density clusters will exhibit faster water dynamics.
      </p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Indeed,  simulations using <em>ab initio</em> <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> interactions support this mechanism for the density fluctuations in liquid water  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1756">1756</a><a name="r1756" id="r1756"></a>].</p>
</div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="min" id="min"></a>The shallow minimum (<strong>A</strong>), 
      due to nonbonded interactions, lies up to 20% inside 
      the deeper minimum (B) due to <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen 
      bonding</a> (even allowing for a 15% closer approach 
      of individual hydrogen-bonded water molecules). In 
      spatial terms, minimum (<strong>A</strong>) is far 
      more extensive as the hydrogen-bonded minimum (<strong>B</strong>) 
      is restricted in its geometry, being highly directional. 
      At lower temperatures (particularly below the <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#density">temperature 
      of maximum density</a>) and pressures, the less dense 
      structure with more extensive hydrogen-bonding at 
      the lower minimum (<strong>B</strong>) will be preferred 
      even though it involves a more ordered (lower entropy) 
      structure. At higher temperatures, nonbonded interactions 
      dominate, causing breakdown of the clustering (Figure inspired by [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r16">16</a><a name="r16" id="r16"></a>]).</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The hydrogen bonding, although cohesive, 
        is thus holding the water molecules apart. It is the conflict 
        between these two effects and how it varies with conditions, 
        which endows water with many unusual properties.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>These <a href="icosahedra.html#octas">bicyclo-octamers may cluster 
        further</a>, with only themselves, to form highly symmetric <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#Fig2">280-molecule

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>As all three of these small clusters are relatively stable  quasi-polyhedra found, their interaction will likely produce these larger icosahedral 
        clusters (and the latter two are the lowest energy structures out of those found by simulating supercooled water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref26.html#r2558">2558</a><a name="r2558" id="r2558"></a>]). Such clusters can dynamically form a continuous network

    <p>On the right is a cartoon to aid the understanding of how the  lifetimes of clusters are independent of the lifetime of individual linkages.  The clusters have a finite lifetime but are constantly present in the water. The cartoon shows a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional  phenomenon. The actual clusters of water molecules are not represented. It is  supposed (opposite) that the star clusters (shown yellow filled) may reform around key  structures (shown as rhombuses, sometimes red, but closed ring oligomers of  H<sub>2</sub>O in water). A few units  move  to break up the existing cluster and help create a new cluster. The new  clusters are identical to the old ones but only contain a proportion of the  units. Thus, dynamic clusters may reform around any of the star arms. One mechanism for such cluster reorientation involves a proton cascade leading to  cluster reorientation   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref25.html#r2423">2423</a><a name="r2423" id="r2423"></a>]. The movement of such clusters may involve them traveling as a wave  through the medium and flickering on and off unpredictably. <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#b">b</a><a name="bb" id="bb"></a></sup> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Clusters give density fluctuations at time scales below a nanosecond but water appears homogeneous at more than a nanosecond time scale [<a  href="ref39.html#r3827" name="r3827" title="go to cited reference" id="r3827">3827</a>]. It has been shown that their lifetimes and sizes increase with decreasing temperature, particularly in the supercooled state.  The interaction energy of 80% of the H-bonding molecular pairs lies between -28 and -16 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>. The number of such bonds does not exceed 15% up to 293 K, and decreases with decreasing temperature.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although the hydrogen bonds between water molecules in ice have equally short lifetimes to those in water, ice cubes, which can be considered as enormous ice clusters, can last forever at 0&nbsp;&deg;C in water. As there is a shift of the water O-H band center of Raman scattering (at about 3300 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) to higher frequencies (shorter wavenumbers, at about 40 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) with decreasing the probe pulse duration from 20 ns to &sim;50 ps [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3363">3363</a><a name="r3363" id="r3363"></a>], it is indicated that there is an increased time required for the formation of large clusters in water via hydrogen-bonding between &#1053;<sub>2</sub>&#1054; molecules.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Similarly, but on a macro-scale on the addition of solutes, water retains its integrity as liquid water with the hydrogen bond network connected throughout  the entire bulk (percolating). The local hydrogen bonds are known to be fleetingly breaking and forming  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2211">2211</a><a name="r2211" id="r2211"></a>]. Cluster formation and lifetime are both increased by the highly cooperative nature of hydrogen bonding. Whenever low-density clusters form, they are surrounded by about the same number of 'decorating' water molecules with intermediate density.</p>

    <p>Such a dynamic fluctuating self-replicating network of water molecules, 
      with localized and overlapping <a href="icosahedra.html">icosahedral 
      symmetry</a>, was first proposed to exist in liquid water 
      in 1998 [<a  href="ref.html#r55" name="r55" id="r55" title="go to cited reference">55</a>]. The structure 
      was subsequently independently found by X-ray diffraction, in 
      water nanodrops in 2001 [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r417">417</a><a name="r417" id="r417"></a>]. 
      The clusters formed can interconvert between lower and higher 
      density forms by bending, but not breaking, some  hydrogen 
      bonds. Due to the cooperative strength of the hydrogen bonds, the structuring of the expanded structures possess slower dynamics and lower entropy whereas the high density structures possess rapid dynamics and greater entropy. Structuring may also flicker between statistically and topographically equivalent 
      clusters but involving different molecules by shifting their cluster 
      centers. These polyhedral structures are idealized in the diagrams but are considerably distorted and fragmented by thermal effects in reality. The existence of long-lived ring fragments is nevertheless considered to be well-founded [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2053">2053</a><a name="r2053" id="r2053"></a>]. The cluster size required for ice formation has been estimated at about 400 molecules (one further layer of water around the icosahedral water core). However, the structure of this core structure was indeterminable [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2088">2088</a><a name="r2088" id="r2088"></a>]. As the temperature increases the average cluster 
      size, the cluster integrity, and the proportion in the low-density 
      form all decrease. This structuring accommodates <a title="go to find more information"  href="phase_anomalies.html">explanation</a> of many of the <a href="water_anomalies.html">anomalous properties

    <h2><a name="life" id="life"></a>The lifetime of the clusters </h2>
    <p>The open low-density cluster <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> is seen as the extreme form of water cluster with its subclusters building up. It is primarily formed in deeply supercooled water or by incorporating stabilizing solutes. It is a relatively long-lived cluster both as a whole and in its parts, particularly the (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>20</sub> and <a href="strand.html#str">(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>100</sub></a> subclusters. Its collapse into the condensed structure (<abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>) is expected to be a significant route for its degradation (rather than the slow loss from its exterior) that may be caused by increased pressure, temperature, or destabilizing solutes. This sudden extensive and comprehensive collapse is a crucial feature of the two-state structuring of water. The condensed structure (<abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>)  is far less stable than the <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> structure or its substructures. It can further change either by reforming <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> or by a further abrupt and comprehensive collapse to form high-density stranded and small ring structures.</p>

    <p><a name="b" id="b"></a><sup>b</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Game of Life is 'played' on an infinite two-dimensional grid of squares, each of which is in one of two possible states, <em>alive</em> or <em>dead</em> (see right for an example). Every cell interacts with its eight adjacent neighbors using the four rules:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol start="1">
      <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.</li>
      <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
      <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
      <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.    </li>
