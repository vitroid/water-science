    <p><a title="go to 'Water molecular structure' page"  href="water_molecule.html">Water</a> (H<sub>2</sub>O) is the 
      third most common molecule in the Universe (after H<sub>2 </sub>and CO), the most abundant substance on earth and the 
      only naturally occurring inorganic liquid, a billion cubic 
      kilometers of which reside in our oceans and 50 tons of which 
      pass through our bodies in our lifetimes. It has been very 
      well studied, with several <a title="more information on molecular models for water" href="water_models.html">model 
      structures</a> having been proposed and refined.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#a"> a</a><a name="ba" id="ba"></a></sup> Notwithstanding this, extensively <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen-bonded</a> liquid water is unique with many <a href="water_anomalies.html">anomalous 
      properties</a>. It has commonly been stated that no single 
      model can explain all of its properties [<a  href="ref.html#r1" name="r1" title="go to cited reference" id="r1">1</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r53" name="r53" title="go to cited reference" id="r53">53a</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r54" name="r54" title="go to cited reference" id="r54">54</a>]. 
      In particular, successful models for water must encompass 
      the <a title="go to 'Evidence for water clusters' page"  href="cluster_evidence.html#Fig1">radial distribution function</a>, 
      the <a title="go to find more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#Pvisc">pressure-viscosity</a>,  <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#density">temperature-density</a> behavior, 
      and the effects of <a title="go to find more on ionic effects" href="hofmeister_series.html">solutes</a>. Much 
      work has been invested in developing <a title="more information on molecular models for water" href="water_models.html">models</a> for individual <a title="go to 'Water molecular structure' page"  href="water_molecule.html">water molecules</a> for molecular dynamics simulations [<a  href="ref.html#r2" name="r2" title="go to cited reference" id="r2">2</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r3" name="r3" title="go to cited reference" id="r3">3</a>]. These models are very 
      useful, particularly for investigating short-range order, 
      but have difficulty addressing the totality of the unusual 
      nature of water, including the long-range ordering that has 
      been described around macromolecules [<a  href="ref.html#r4" name="r4" title="go to cited reference" id="r4">4</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r5" name="r5" title="go to cited reference" id="r5">5</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r6" name="r6" title="go to cited reference" id="r6">6</a>]. 
      In particular, they only show approximate agreement with the 
      radial distribution functions, and most have difficulty explaining 
      the position and size of the <a href="cluster_evidence.html#r3.7">peak 
      at about 3.7 </a>
      <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r3">3</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r7" name="r7" title="go to cited reference" id="r7">7</a>]. 
      Several <a href="cluster_evidence.html#interstit">interstitial models</a> have been described based on dodecahedra [<a  href="ref.html#r8" name="r8" title="go to cited reference" id="r8">8, 
      8b</a>], the <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html">ice Ih</a> structure [<a  href="ref.html#r9" name="r9" title="go to cited reference" id="r9">9</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r10" name="r10" title="go to cited reference" id="r10">10</a>], 
      or computer simulation [<a  href="ref.html#r66" name="r66" title="go to cited reference" id="r66">66</a>]. 
      These involve the presence of water molecules within cavities 
      in the hydrogen-bonded network. A percolation model, where 
      the degree of hydrogen bonding decreases as temperature increases, 
      has also been developed [<a  href="ref.html#r11" name="r11" title="go to cited reference" id="r11">11</a>]. 
      Although good at explaining some, if not all, of the properties 
      of water, its nature is still unclear.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Explanations 
      of the properties of water have been in terms of non-bonded 
      interactions in a fully bonded network [<a  href="ref.html#r12" name="r12" title="go to cited reference" id="r12">12</a>], 
      significant bending in the hydrogen bonds [<a  href="ref.html#r13" name="r13" title="go to cited reference" id="r13">13</a>], <a href="clusters_overview.html#min">competition between bonded and 
      non-bonded interactions</a> [<a  href="ref.html#r14" name="r14" title="go to cited reference" id="r14">14</a>, <a  href="ref4.html#r311" name="r311" title="go to cited reference" id="r311">311</a>], or equilibrium 
      between structural components containing hexagonal, pentagonal 
      and dodecahedral water arrays [<a  href="ref.html#r15" name="r15" title="go to cited reference" id="r15">15</a>]. 
      The unusual properties of water at mixed hydrophilic/hydrophobic 
      surfaces have been explained in terms of the presence of both 
      high-density water and strongly associated (low-density) water 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r851">851</a><a name="r851" id="r851"></a>]. Reviews 
      outlining the relationship between liquid, supercooled, and <a href="water_phase_diagram.html" name="LDA" title="go to a description of water's phases" id="LDA">low-density amorphous ice</a> (LDA) [<a  href="ref.html#r16" name="r16" title="go to cited reference" id="r16">16</a>] and the relationship 
      between the bulk structure of water and calculated and experimental 
      data on small water clusters [<a  href="ref3.html#r226" name="r226" title="go to cited reference" id="r226">226</a>] 
      have appeared. The present review has its roots in 
      a paper [<a  href="ref.html#r55" name="r55" title="go to cited reference" id="r55">55</a>] that 
      includes  several of these approaches. A brief 
      history of the development of the water clustering concept<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#b"> b</a><a name="bb" id="bb"></a></sup> is given on <a href="cluster_history.html">another page</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>While the molecular movements within <a href="cluster_evidence.html#structure">liquid 
      water </a>require the constant breaking and reorganization 
      of individual hydrogen bonds on a picosecond timescale, it 
      is thought by some that the instantaneous degree of <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen-bonding</a> is very high (&gt;95%, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r13">13</a>, <a  href="ref2.html#r168" name="r168" title="go to cited reference" id="r168">168</a>] 
      at about 0&nbsp;&deg;C to about 85% at 100&nbsp;&deg;C [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r168">168</a>]) 
      and gives rise to extensive networks, actively aided by bonding cooperativity. 
      It has been suggested that there will be a temperature-dependent 
      competition between the ordering effects of hydrogen bonding 
      and the disordering kinetic effects [<a  href="ref.html#r17" name="r17" title="go to cited reference" id="r17">17</a>]. 
      There are <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/2004/11/08/14/1" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin2" onclick="newWin('otherWin2')">many 
      pieces of evidence</a> indicating that the time-averaged hydrogen-bonded 
      network possesses a large extent of order. These include the <a href="cluster_evidence.html#fine">fine structure</a> in the diffraction 
      data [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r9">9</a>], microwave dielectric relaxation 
      measurements on glucose solutions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r6">6</a>], 
      vibrational spectra that have indicated the presence of large 
      clusters [<a  href="ref.html#r18" name="r18" title="go to cited reference" id="r18">18</a>],  collective dipole orientation fluctuations with   time-scales  50,000 times slower than expected [<a href="ref11.html#r1034">1034</a><a name="r1034" id="r1034"></a>], and the 
      formation and properties of low-density water in gels [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r4">4</a>]. 
      There is some evidence that water is self-organizing [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r581">581</a><a name="r581" id="r581"></a>] and can exist as macro-scale (10-120 &micro;m) clusters [<a href="ref14.html#r1329">1329</a><a name="r1329" id="r1329"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A random network model has been described for <abbr title="Low density amorphous ice">LDA</abbr> [<a  href="ref.html#r19" name="r19" title="go to cited reference" id="r19">19</a>], liquid [<a  href="ref3.html#r261" name="r261" title="go to cited reference" id="r261">261</a>], 
      and supercooled water [<a  href="ref.html#r20" name="r20" title="go to cited reference" id="r20">20</a>]. 
      However, although this model is simple, requiring no 'fitting' 
      parameters, and has proven to be useful [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref3.html#r261">261</a>], 
      it fails to describe some of water's properties unless made 
      inhomogeneous; for example, the entropy of <abbr title="Low density amorphous ice">LDA</abbr> is much lower than can be explained by this model [<a  href="ref.html#r21" name="r21" title="go to cited reference" id="r21">21</a>]. 
      A variation of this model concentrates on pentagonal rings 
      and cavities [<a  href="ref4.html#r366" name="r366" title="go to cited reference" id="r366">366</a>]. 
      Several workers suggest that the structure of liquid water 
      should be related to crystalline ice structures [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r6">6</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r22" name="r22" title="go to cited reference" id="r22">22</a>]. However, this structuring 
      must be significantly different due to the ease with which 
      water supercools and its high heat of fusion. It has similarly 
      been proposed to be a mixture of almost equal quantities of 
      low (<abbr title="Low density amorphous ice">LDA</abbr>) 
      and high-density amorphous ice (<abbr title="High density amorphous ice">HDA</abbr>) 
      [<a  href="ref3.html#r262" name="r262" title="go to cited reference" id="r262">262</a>] or related if 
      less well defined, clusters [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r732">732</a><a name="r732" id="r732"></a>]. 
      A <a href="cluster_history.html#outer">two-state network model </a>including <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html">ice Ih</a> (hexagonal ice) 
      and <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_ii.html">ice-two</a> (ice II) substructures, 
      locally rearranging on a picosecond timescale, has been used 
      to explain many of the properties of water [<a  href="ref.html#r23" name="r23" title="go to cited reference" id="r23">23</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r56" name="r56" title="go to cited reference" id="r56">56</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r57" name="r57" title="go to cited reference" id="r57">57</a>, <a  href="ref3.html#r268" name="r268" title="go to cited reference" id="r268">268</a>]. Although attractive, 
      the inclusion of explicit ice-two clusters in this model leads 
      to some difficulties. For example, a pressure requirement for 
      the extensive ice-two cluster formation is necessary to achieve 
      the density of water, the ordered nature of the hydroge bonding 
      in ice-two, and consequent extremely low relative permittivity (dielectric constant) 
      (3.7 [<a  href="ref.html#r94" name="r94" title="go to cited reference" id="r94">94</a>]). The source of this pressure is not 
      apparent in liquid water. Also, it is unclear how the number of   experimental 
      non-bonded close contacts can be achieved. Indeed, later  there was less emphasis  placed on the explicit inclusion of ice-two in this model 
      by its proposers [<a  href="ref.html#r60" name="r60" title="go to cited reference" id="r60">60</a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r409">409</a><a name="r409" id="r409"></a>]. In many 
      respects, the outer-structure two-state mixture model [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r409">409</a>] 
      is not inconsistent with the model described here 
      with accord concerning both the 'key features' [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r409">409</a>] 
      of O&middot;&middot;&middot;O <a href="cluster_evidence.html#r3.7">next 
      near-neighbor distances</a> and O&middot;&middot;&middot;O&middot;&middot;&middot;O 
      hydrogen bond angle distribution. A related two-state model, 
      including <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html">ice Ih</a> and <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_iii.html">ice-three</a> (ice III) substructures, has been used to explain hydration 
      thermodynamics [<a  href="ref4.html#r318" name="r318" title="go to cited reference" id="r318">318</a>]. 
      Other workers have used less explicit two-state models possessing 
      high and low-density components to explain the properties 
      of supercooled water [<a  href="ref.html#r24" name="r24" title="go to cited reference" id="r24">24</a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r790">790</a><a name="r790" id="r790"></a>], the pressure-dependent 
      growth of the <a href="cluster_evidence.html#r3.7">peak at about 3.7 </a>
      <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> in the radial distribution function [<a  href="ref.html#r25" name="r25" title="go to cited reference" id="r25">25</a>], 
      and many other anomalies [<a  href="ref.html#r86" name="r86" title="go to cited reference" id="r86">86</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Water dodecahedra have been found in aqueous solutions [<a  href="ref.html#r26" name="r26" title="go to cited reference" id="r26">26</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r27" name="r27" title="go to cited reference" id="r27">27</a>], crystals [<a  href="ref17.html#r1652" name="r1652" title="go to cited reference" id="r1652">1652</a>], and  the <a href="magic.html">gas 
      phase</a> [<a  href="ref.html#r28" name="r28" title="go to cited reference" id="r28">28</a>]. Dodecahedral 
      water clusters have also been reported at <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">hydrophobic</a> and <a href="protein_hydration.html" title="more on protein hydration" >protein</a> surfaces [<a  href="ref.html#r89" name="r89" title="go to cited reference" id="r89">89</a>], 
      where low-density water with stronger hydrogen bonds and lower entropy 
      has been found [<a  href="ref.html#r29" name="r29" title="go to cited reference" id="r29">29</a>]. Similar 
      dodecahedral cavities have been located in <abbr title="Low density amorphous ice">LDA</abbr> [<a  href="ref.html#r30" name="r30" title="go to cited reference" id="r30">30</a>] and form relatively abundantly 
      in water during molecular simulations [<a  href="ref.html#r31" name="r31" title="go to cited reference" id="r31">31</a>]. They are associated with the minimum solvent water molecules required to solvate one water molecule [<a  href="ref43.html#r4254" name="r4254" title="go to cited reference" id="r4254">4254</a>].</p>

    <p>In these pages, a <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html">dynamic structural model for water 
      is proposed</a> originating in 2000, that both builds on and is consistent with many 
      of these different approaches. The basis of this model is a network 
      that can convert between lower and higher density forms without 
      breaking hydrogen bonds. It includes a mixture of hexamer and pentamer 
      substructures and contains cavities capable of enclosing small solutes. 
      The model was developed by arranging <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice1h1c.html">alternating 
      sheets of boat-form and chair-form water hexamers</a> from the lattices 
      of <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html">hexagonal</a> and <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="cubic_ice.html">cubic 
      ice,</a> respectively. This structure was folded to form an icosahedral 
      three-dimensional network with capacious pores capable of partial 
      collapse due to competition between bonded and non-bonded interactions. This theory has resulted in the debate and criticism expected of new science but has held itself together through many  discussions, theories and hypotheses over the years without significant alteration and still enables understanding of the properties of water.</p>

    <p><a name="ktheta" id="ktheta"></a>In order to develop the (<a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html">icosahedral water 
      clusters</a>) model described, molecular model building and dynamics 
      were performed using the HyperChem (<a href="http://www.hyper.com/" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin1" onclick="newWin('otherWin1')">Hypercube 
      Inc</a>., Ontario, Canada) molecular modeling package. To obtain 
      the coordinates, the network was optimized using the <abbr title="Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement">AMBER</abbr> force field with particular parameters (O&middot;&middot;&middot;O 
      stretch 28 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a><sup>&minus;1</sup>, O&middot;&middot;&middot;O 
      distance 2.84 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>; O&middot;&middot;&middot;O&middot;&middot;&middot;O 
      bend (k<sub>&theta;</sub>) varying about 4 
      kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> rad<sup>&minus;2</sup>, from 109.47&deg;; van der 
      Waals <abbr title="Lennard-Jones distance">&sigma;</abbr> = 3.536 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>, <abbr title="Lennard-Jones energy">&epsilon;</abbr> = 0.636 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>). These parameters were chosen as reasonable 
      to create the model but were not critical. All data reported are 
      derived from structures with average O&middot;&middot;&middot;O 
      and O-H nearest neighbor distances of 2.82 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> and 0.96 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;,</a> respectively. Hydrogen atoms were not treated explicitly, being 
      placed such that each oxygen has two near and two far hydrogen neighbors 
      after the model building was completed.</p>
