    <h2><a name="hy" id="hy"></a>Hydration</h2>
    <p align="left"> Using a simplistic 
      approach to polysaccharide hydration, water can be divided into 
      'bound water',<sup><a href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#c" name="bc" id="bc"> c</a></sup> subcategorized as being capable of freezing or not, 
      and 'unbound water', subcategorized as being trapped or not, and with
      'hydration' as a general term concerning the amount of bound water. The term 'bound' is poorly understood, being very 
      difficult to explain (or investigate) exactly, and has been defined 
      (perhaps in desperation) as 'non-bulk' water. 'Unbound' 
      water freezes at the same temperature as normal water (&lt; 0&nbsp;&deg;C 
      dependent on cooling rate). However, some water may take up to 24 
      hr to freeze. 'Bound freezable' water freezes at a lower temperature 
      than normal water, being easily supercooled. It also exhibits a 
      reduced enthalpy of fusion (melting). Although the inability to 
      freeze is often used to determine bound water, freezing may not 
      a good measure of hydration as it concerns the water content of 
      the <a href="rheology.html#glass">glassy state</a> and not aqueous hydration. 
      However, alternative determinants of 'bound' water, such as the use 
      of NMR, are also problematic as NMR determines binding dynamics (rates 
      of dissociation involving dissociation activation energy) rather 
      than thermodynamics (free energy changes).&nbsp;Reaction of polysaccharides to form unnatural analogs, such as through methylation, carboxymethylation, or deoxyfluorination, usually cause great changes in their mechanical and structural properties and allow the establishment of detailed structure-property correlations   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref39.html#r3814">3814</a><a name="r3814" id="r3814"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">A high degree of branching in a polysaccharide (or crosslinking) has been found to lead to a more low-density water structuring (<abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>-like ) and stronger binding of the water micro-pools [<a  href="ref27.html#r2643" name="r2643" title="go to cited reference" id="r2643">2643</a>]. [<a title="go to top of page" href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>
    <h2><a name="alt" id="alt"></a>Alternatives for defining bound and unbound water</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bound water; divided into non-freezing (see [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r445">445</a><a name="r445" id="r445"></a>, <a  href="ref31.html#r3050" name="r3050" title="go to cited reference" id="r3050">3050</a>]) 
        and freezing.<br />
        Unbound water; divided into trapped and bulk.</li>
      <li>Bound water; divided into tightly bound (removed by freeze-drying) 
        and loosely bound (removed by centrifugation.<br />
        Unbound water (removed by filtration).</li>
</ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For alternative (1), the type of water is determined by</p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>(a) freezing 
      and melting calorimetry using the enthalpy of the phase change [<a  href="ref16.html#r1514" name="r1514" title="go to cited reference" id="r1514">1514</a>, <a  href="ref31.html#r3050">3050</a>], </p>
    <p>(b) thermogravimetry, measuring the weight changes due to absorption 
      from set <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#l">humidity</a> atmospheres, and </p>
    <p>(c) <sup>1</sup>H NMR spin-lattice (longitudinal, T<sub>1</sub> ) and spin-spin (transverse, T<sub>2</sub> ) relaxation times [<a  href="ref31.html#r3050" title="go to cited reference">3050</a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The presence of sufficient freezing bound water<sup><a href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#b" name="bb" id="bb">b</a></sup> is required for preferred biocompatibility. It is supposed that such a layer shields the inner non-freezing water layer  from the hydration shell of other biological components [<a  href="ref17.html#r1700" name="r1700" title="go to cited reference" id="r1700">1700</a>]. Non-freezing water may be 
      trapped in a <a href="rheology.html#glass">glassy state</a>, lowering 
      diffusion by several orders of magnitude and hindering crystal formation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For the less precise alternative (2), which is used in the dietary 
      fiber area, the firmly held water not removed by centrifugation, 
      gives the water binding capacity (WBC), whereas the loosely associated 
      water, which is not removed by filtration, gives the water holding 
      capacity (WHC).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> However, both schemes only determine what they measure which may be somewhat different from what they represent as measuring; that is aqueous hydration. At present, the literature 
      provides little sound explanatory theory for polysaccharide hydration, 
      with poor predictability. Another variable concerns dried polysaccharides; the method of drying leaves different amounts and forms of the remaining water with some structural properties unchanged (Infrared Spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction spectrum) while others are changed (Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) [<a  href="ref39.html#r3900" name="r3900" title="go to cited reference" id="r3900">3900</a>]. Vacuum freeze-drying, vacuum drying, and hot-air drying methods have given differences in scavenging free radicals tests.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In practical experience, the effects of water on polysaccharides 
      and polysaccharides on the water are complex and become even more complex 
      in the presence of other materials, such as salts. Water competes 
      for hydrogen-bonding sites with intramolecular and intermolecular 
      hydrogen-bonding, which certainly will determine the carbohydrate's flexibility 
      and may determine the carbohydrate's preferred conformation(s) [<a  href="ref3.html#r254" name="r254" title="go to cited reference" id="r254">254</a>]. 
      There is a high entropic cost (up to about 20.8 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> at 25&nbsp;&deg;C for a totally 'frozen' molecule) when water is bound, 
      and this must be reclaimed, for example, by the formation of stronger 
      or extra <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen bonds</a> [<a  href="ref4.html#r320" name="r320" title="go to cited reference" id="r320">320</a>]. 
      There are several questions to be answered:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the cause of different types of water-binding?</li>
      <li>What is the effect of hydration on polysaccharide structure, for example, gel formation?</li>
      <li>What is the effect of the polysaccharides on water structure, for example, vibrational spectra?</li>
      <li>What is the effect of hydration on the physical properties, for example, solubility, freezing point, density, and viscosity?</li>
      <li>What is the effect of ions?</li>
      <li>What is the effect of solutes?</li>
</ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>These questions can be answered by considering the following effects 
      on the polysaccharide hydration: polar, weak hydrogen-bonding, strong 
      hydrogen-bonding, <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#philic" title="go to find out more">hydrophobic</a>, and the presence of other non-ionic 
      and ionic solutes.<sup><a href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#a" name="ab" id="ab"> a</a></sup> </p>

    <p align="left">D-galacturonic acid residues 
      occur in <a href="pectin.html">pectins</a> and tightly bind 
      some water molecules. However, the amount bound  depends 
      mainly on the cation counter-ion present rather than the sugar 
      residue. Thus, sodium galacturonate binds 4 molecules, and 
      the K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> salts 
      bind 2, 12, and 13 water molecules respectively (water-ion 
      binding greater than 13.0 kcal mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> [<a  href="ref3.html#r250" name="r250" title="go to cited reference" id="r250">250</a>]). 
      Both acid oxygen atoms of the carboxylate group prefer to 
      accept two or three hydrogen bonds, dependent on steric factors, 
      each provided from different water molecules due to steric 
      and anti-cooperative effects, and as shown by an <em>ab initio</em> study [<a  href="ref4.html#r316" name="r316" title="go to cited reference" id="r316">316</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As the distance between the two carboxylate oxygen atoms (O6A&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;O6B) 
      is smaller (at about 2.2 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>) than H<sub>2</sub>O&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;HOH <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen-bonded</a> O&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;O 
      distance (at about 2.8 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>), these water molecules will only 
      fit in a locally collapsed, weaker, water structure.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="zones" id="zones"></a>As <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen-bonding</a> (through donation) is weakened if one of the donor hydrogen bonds 
      of water is hydrogen-bonded to a stronger base than water, carboxylates 
      are expected to give rise to a particularly weak hydrogen bond in 
      the next shell, so encouraging a local collapse in the hydrogen-bonded 
      network. Near polyelectrolytes, the <a href="moles_molarity_molality.html#osm">osmolality</a> is high, and <a href="water_activity.html">water 
      activity</a> and chemical potential are low. The potential of water 
      is partially increased by collapsing the hydrogen bond network. 
      If the surface is highly charged, the high-density water (HDW) zone 
      may reach out to several nanometers, and the local density of the 
      first hydration shell may be greater than 1.1 g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>. 
      The zone is weakly hydrogen-bonded, fluid, and reactive, and accumulates 
      small cations, multivalent anions, and hydrophobic solutes. In order 
      to keep the potential of the water constant, the water surrounding 
      this low potential <abbr title="higher density water">HDW</abbr> zone is reduced in potential to match, producing a zone of lower 
      density water (LDW), which may be extensive enough as to lower the 
      overall density of the medium [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r407">407</a><a name="r407" id="r407"></a>]. 
      These two zones (<abbr title="higher density water">HDW</abbr>) 
      and (<abbr title="lower density water">LDW</abbr>) are unlikely 
      to be sharply distinguishable or perfectly formed, but the chemical 
      potential of the water will be similar throughout.&nbsp;This may be the case, as found in the domain structure of solutions [<a  href="ref12.html#r1148" name="r1148" title="go to cited reference" id="r1148">1148</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The polysaccharide chain rigidity will depend on whether the counter 
      ions are close (leading to possible intermolecular attraction but 
      reducing the intramolecular charge repulsion) or far away (for example, in the <abbr title="lower density water">LDW</abbr>). The 
      rules for the formation of <a title="go to find more on ionic effects" href="hofmeister_series.html#ionpair">ion-pairs</a> are followed with the carboxylate group considered to be poorly 
      hydrated, so strongly hydrated ions (for example, Li<sup>+</sup>, 
      Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) will adsorb to the ionic surfaces 
      less readily than poorly hydrated ions (for example, Cs<sup>+</sup>, 
      K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some poly-ionic polysaccharides (for example, <a href="pectin.html">pectins</a> with more than 57% unmethylated carboxylate groups) can form junction 
      zones utilizing  divalent cations (for example, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) 
      so long as a minimum of 14 residues can cooperate. It may well be 
      that two carboxylate groups have to cooperate in prizing the bound 
      water away from the calcium ions to form the salt links that make 
      up the junction zones. The low potential of the water associated 
      with the ion pairs will affect nearby water to encourage a leveling 
      of the water potentials. This causes surrounding water to become 
      more expanded (lower in density).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The <a href="interfacial_water.html#b">&zeta;-potential</a> of polysaccharides  is frequently used to understand polysaccharide-protein complexation, but the actual binding depends on how close the protein can get to the charged sites [<a  href="ref32.html#r3136" name="r3136" title="go to cited reference" id="r3136">3136</a>].</p>

    <p align="left">Strong hydrogen bonding requires 
      two hydrogen bonds from the polysaccharide to the same water 
      molecule, one as a donor and one as an acceptor for maximum cooperativity. 
      Strong (double) hydrogen-bonded water links often appear to 
      displace single intra-residue hydrogen bonds as they have 
       similar requirements for suitably oriented vicinal hydroxyls, 
      and their presence can reduce the stereochemical demands. 
      Such hydrogen bonding is likely to be stronger if the hydroxyl 
      groups have less flexibility. Thus, hydrogen-bonding strength 
      will generally follow the trend: neighboring on pyran (for example, as shown opposite) &gt; neighboring on furan &gt; between 
      hydroxyl groups on neighboring residues &gt; between ring 
      hydroxyl and methylhydroxyl  groups. Polysaccharides are more hydrophobic 
      if they have intra-molecular hydrogen bonds. However, the fixed orientation of the doubly-linked 
      water molecules may increase the hydrophobic extent of the carbohydrate's 
      top and bottom surfaces and so aid the formation of <a name="junct" id="junct"></a> junction zones. This is a cooperative process that may take some 
      time. If the doubly bound water is replaced by two singly bound 
      water molecules, the polysaccharide will become less hydrophobic, 
      there will be a further entry of water and a partial break-up of 
      any junction zones. However, as the formation of junction zones 
      is a cooperative process, it will be difficult to reverse. Also, 
      singly-linked water molecules involve greater (energetically unfavorable) 
      rearrangements in the surrounding water. If all other factors are 
      equal, the preferences being: intramolecular hydrogen-bond &gt; 
      doubly hydrogen-bond linked water &gt; two singly hydrogen-bond 
      linked water molecules.&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>

      be considered as having two hydrophobic surfaces with a hydrogen-bonding 
      edge. The &quot;<a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">hydrophobic effect</a>&quot; 
      is primarily a consequence of changes in the clustering in 
      the surrounding water rather than water-solute interactions. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Where low-density water (LDW) overlays hydrophobic surfaces, there 
      will be a tendency for surface minimization by surfaces interacting 
      and excluding water, causing the formation of junction zones. It 
      is the incompatibility between the <abbr title="lower density water">LDW</abbr> and the hydrophobic surface that drives the structure formation. 
      The formation of low-density water next to hydrophobic surfaces 
      and concomitant junction zone formation are encouraged if this low-density 
      water is also associated with high-density water created near  
      polar groups (<a title="click for an explanation" href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#polar">see above</a>). Alternatively, strong local 
      hydrogen-bonding may be able to create low-density water 
      without assistance. It is likely, however that local weak hydrogen 
      bonding will discourage junction zone formation. It is noteworthy 
      that the hydrophobic effect decreases with increased pressure (or 
      density) as it is dependent on the presence of tetrahedrally-placed 
      water molecules (as in LDW), which reduce in number under the distorting 
      influence of pressure [<a  href="ref7.html#r626" name="r626" title="go to cited reference" id="r626">626</a>].&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>

      This exclusion entropically 'drives' junction formation. Low molecular 
      weight sugars can cause hydrogen-bonding links between polysaccharides

    <p>The effects of dissolved gases are often ignored. However,

      Some gases are essentially structuring (for example, O<sub>2</sub>,

    <h2><a name="ionic" id="ionic"></a>Effects of other solutes: ionic</h2>
    <p>Ions generally have an effect on the structure of water like increased 
      temperature or pressure. Small ions are strongly hydrated, creating 
      local order but destroying the natural hydrogen-bonded network. 
      The <a title="go to find more on ionic effects" href="hofmeister_series.html">Hofmeister series</a> shows the promotion 
      of hydrophobic associations, such that ions favoring low-density 
      water promote amylose retrogradation and starch gelatinization. 
      Ions in polysaccharide solutions may behave differently from when 
      in solution by themselves, as the polysaccharides are capable of 
      producing relatively stable low-density or high-density aqueous 
      microenvironments. If  LDW accumulates solute at a charged interface, it will relax back to average  density, as will the associated HDW. Structure-making salts concentrate in a less structured 
      aqueous phase and decrease the compatibility between hydrophilic 
      polymers, while structure-breaking salts concentrate in more structured 
      environments and increase such compatibility.&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>

        junction zones by itself; it must be aided by externally created <abbr title="lower density water">LDW</abbr> using the <abbr title="higher density water">HDW</abbr> double layers or 'strong' hydrogen bonds.</li>
      <li>If the fiber possesses more order,  so will the water [<a  href="ref4.html#r338" name="r338" title="go to cited reference" id="r338">338</a>]; 
        flexible molecules shedding their <abbr title="lower density water">LDW</abbr> as they move.</li>
      <li>Much water is held close to junction zones (mostly freezing 
        bound water) and this increases with the extent of junction zone 
        formation.</li>
      <li>Water partially held within the polysaccharide structure (for example, within the axial <a href="rheology.html#rg">radius 
        of gyration</a>) will have restricted diffusion as it can only 
        move in one direction.</li>
      <li>If more <abbr title="lower density water">LDW</abbr> is 
        present,  water self-diffusion will decrease, but viscosity 
        and shear thinning will increase.</li>
      <li>Polymers are almost impenetrable to other polymers due to structured 
        hydration. If the molecules have the same hydration characteristics, 
        the structures may form junction zones,  'combining' the hydration 
        layers. If they do not have the same hydration characteristics, the organization of 
        water is by means of <a title="go for more details" href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">hydrophobic hydration</a>.<br />

      <li>Low-density, strongly bound water associated with oriented strongly 
        hydrogen-bonding groups.</li>
      <li>Low-density, weakly bound water associated with hydrophobic groups.</li>
      <li>Mixed unbound compartmentalized water (caused by hydration effects).&nbsp;</li>

The broadest definition is that &nbsp;'bound' water is that water in the vicinity of a macromolecule whose properties differ detectably from those of the 'bulk' water in the same system. 'Free' water is that water not 'bound'. This definition depends on the detection system used, with other definitions of 'bound' lying with boundaries within this definition's boundaries. Often there is no sharp physical 'boundary' that separates 'bound' from 'free' or' bulk' water.
