<p><strong>Greetings Mr. Chaplin</strong>  I have been researching via the internet, for the answer to a question I have.  I have found little information but also differing opinions upon the matter, even within the resource  which I consider most accurate and  reliable. wikipedia.org physicsforums.com physics.stackexchange.com sciforums.com sciencedirect.com also other internet sites The question is simply as follows. What effect does an increase in the air pressure above either a water based electrolyte or simply pure water as electrolyte,have upon the efficiency of the splitting of the water into H, H and O by the electrolysis ?                 or stated another way.... How is the electrical wattage input, per unit of volume of H, H, O produced, changed in relation to that pressure? ............... I am aware that the bubble size of the released gases, while within the electrolyte,  become smaller as pressure increases during electrolysis. Bubble size in turn, affects the amount of electrode surface area which is in contact with the liquid electrolyte. Smaller bubbles more effectively isolate the electrode from the solution than do larger bubbles.           this Increases electrical resistance, decreases amperage flowing through the electrolyte and slows the production rate of the H, H, O. This is not an issue about which I have concerns. ...............          also My question does not concern any efficiency which might be gained in terms of a later stage of pressurization of the gases, as compared to gas pressurization either during and or by, the electrolysis itself. ............                          </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For convenience and clarity, I restate my question below. What effect does an increase in the air pressure above the water based electrolyte have upon the efficiency of the splitting of the water into H, H and O by the electrolysis ?                 or in other words.... How is the electrical wattage input, per unit of volume of H, H, O produced, changed in relation to that pressure? Thanks very much for your time.      best wishes         </p>

    <p><strong>Dear Prof. Chaplin</strong>, I can only hope that you wouldn't treat a sincere thank  you (instead of an elaborate and thought provoking criticism from a peer)  as mere spam. Your page appeared at just the right time for this PhD  student, who was desperately looking for a comprehensive guide to topics  such as water structure, solvation, ion-specific interactions,  Hofmeister series, ion pairing and more. As a strictly organic/synthetic chemist  (if anything) by passion, to find myself alone against a time limit to  write a meaningful paper concerning all of the above in relation  to my set of compounds... was overwhelming, to say the least. Sadly, I  don't personally know any specialists in the field (at my  university or neighboring ones) that I could turn to; but now I think I  can find my footing, with the help of your page (and the astounding  amount of referenced papers and books!). I can only hope I will be  up to the task. Again, enormous thanks from a fan from Poland, best wishes to you and your whole family,</p>        
<p>Sincerely, &#321;ukasz Tabisz, Faculty of Supramolecular Chemistry, Department of  Chemistry, Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland</p>

<p><strong>Dear  Professor Chaplin, </strong>You website  on Water Structure and Science is awesome! A tremendous amount of work that  should be highly commended. I was hoping to reference it somehow as a review  source in an upcoming publication we are working on related to anion effects on  concentrated protein solutions. Do you have a proper citation for the site?</p>

<p><strong>Hi Martin</strong>, Thanks for your comprehensive website on water. I  suppose several graduate courses wouldn't be able to teach everything about  water.</p>        
<p>About homeopathy, it is very interesting that the effects  grow stronger with dilution. The theory of dissolved silicates and other  glassware interactions could be useful, although my only real experience with  homeopathy is with the ultra-purified de-ionized water (DIW) used in  semiconductor cleanrooms. Although one would think DIW is the safest water on  Earth to drink, such is not the case. Bacteria blooms are common in cleanrooms.  Even if you drink DIW straight from the filtration system, you can get a bacteria  bloom in your stomach that will make you sick. I heard of a cleanroom worker  who had an ulcer and took to drinking the DIW. It wasn't long before he was  coughing up blood.</p>        
<p>This ability of DIW to cause bacteria blooms matches the  theory of homeopathy practitioners. City water chlorine is diluted to the point  that it causes the opposite biological effect to occur. Instead of inhibiting  bacterial growth, it causes the DIW to accelerate it. The plumbing for DIW is  not glass. It's either stainless steel or plastic tubing such as HDPE or PP. I  don't know what all materials are in the filters themselves, but probably not  glass.</p>        
<p>If there is information storage in the water, it doesn't  necessarily break the second law of thermodynamics. It just means the  boundaries of the system are misunderstood. When an illusionist pulls a rabbit  out of a hat, it's not magic. There's a logical place that rabbit came from. <br />
  It's a matter of working out how nature does its David  Copperfield act.</p>

<p><strong>I greatly  appreciate your article</strong> titled as above,however to cement the equations may you  give me one or two practically worked examples. For example - If i place  a beaker of say 100ml of water in a microwave oven for a given time,can I  calculate say rate of temperature rise,power consumed,electric field &nbsp;etc</p>

    <p><strong>Dear  Professor Chaplin, </strong> Searching  the web for density information for water isotopologues (to correct for  buoyancy when weighing and mixing them) I found your website (or rather your  library of websites) on water. This is very, very impressive! My compliments,  and my sincere thanks. I found what I needed, including the proper references,  and I will &quot;spread the news&quot; about your water website further.    </p>

    <p><strong>Dear Professor Chaplin,</strong> Thank you very much&nbsp; for so  generously sharing your knowledge through your internet site!    </p>
    <p>I came across to it while I&nbsp;was  searching some material on&nbsp;maximum and minimum water content that a living  cell can withstand without dying. I would be interested in knowing about some  experiment or processes in which&nbsp;a cell is kept without  nutrients&nbsp;while it dehydrates or over-hydrates progressively,&nbsp;e.g.,  because it is in contact with an hypertonic or&nbsp;hypotonic solution. I  wonder if there are limit values of intracellular water content beyond which  the cell cannot survive. </p>
    <p>I hope you do not mind if I take the  liberty to address this issue here, and I hope you are&nbsp;so benevolent as to  share with me a bit of your most valuable knowledge. </p>

    <p><strong>Dear Professor Emeritus Chaplin</strong>, may I first congradulate you for your very informative  website. Then to ask the following questions; the increasing value  of latent heat released from a freezing sample coincides with nucleation? Would  you agree that after this release, the latent heat reaches a plateau (freezing  point), that coincides with crystal growth.    Many thanks for your answers.    </p>
    <p>With kind regards, Elias Anastassopoulos</p>
    <p>PS. You may include my email at your guestbook.</p>
    <p>Wed August 27 2014 09:41</p>
    <p><span class="style13">Martin replies: The nucleation only involves a very small proportion of  the ice and the measured latent heat involves the whole process, so I do not  agree with your hypothesis.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Dear Dr. Chaplin</strong>,    Alfons  Geiger, University of Dortmund, gave me yesterday the hint on your phantastic  website, &rdquo; Water structure and Science&rdquo; ! Congratulations on this work. ! I  hope you agree that I immediately added the address of the site to the  web-links&nbsp; of the german Wikipedia Article &ldquo;Eigenschaften des Wassers&rdquo;  (Properties of water).    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Perhaps  you know that, before my retirement, I published also some work on water and  aqueous solutions. In particular we measured very accurately the self-diffusion  coefficient D of water as a function of temperature. The paper is meanwhile  well accepted as a reference source for accurate self-diffusion coefficients,  in particular in the NMR community. Looking through your article, I saw that  you give still the self-diffusion coefficients of water, heavy water, taken  from older books, e.g., of Kauzman, which are slightly different from our recent  &nbsp;results (and the agreeing results of the Mills group in Australia).  Therefore I attach our paper to this mail, hoping it will find your  consideration!<br />

      1) &nbsp;The  electric fields will induce the water dipole to reorient the water  molecule to the time varying field. &nbsp;The ability of <br />
      the water  dipole to reorient to the field is a function of frequency, power of the  field, temperature of the water, the water <br />
      dielectric  properties, water type and purity, and the bonding of the water to  the cloth. &nbsp;For cloth that is hydrophobic there <br />
      will be little  bonding of the water to the cloth, for cloth that is hydrophilic  there will be more bonding. &nbsp;Also effecting the water's ability  to orient to the fields is if the water is constrained by  those cloth interactions verses generally just taking up  the free space in the cloth. <br />
      2)  &nbsp;Assuming the dipole reorients with the time varying field heat is  produced and the thermal equilibrium of the system <br />
      changes.  &nbsp;This changes the vapor pressure encouraging water to  transition to a gas state and leave the cloth. &nbsp;I am <br />
      currently  reading the following papers to try and understand the  relationships between textiles and water better. <br />

    <p><strong>Dear Professor Chaplin</strong>, &nbsp;I think your website is quite  wonderful and unique. I advice most of my students to have a careful look at  it. I  am myself very much interested in the dynamics of liquid water and hydrogen  bond. To this aim I perform experimental studies of physical quantities such as  proton momentum distribution and proton mean kinetic energy of water and water  systems in bulk and confined geometry via Deep Inelastic Neutron Scattering  (the neutron&nbsp;Counterpart&nbsp;of  Compton x-ray Scattering) .&nbsp;&nbsp;If you  think this work might be of some interest for your web page I will happy to  send you my full list of publications on this matter. <br />
      Looking  forward to hearing from you, Best  regards, Carla  Andreani    </p>

    <p><strong>Dear Martin Chaplin </strong>I have followed your page for years. Looked in it, read parts of it, understood a little of it now and then. (I studied chemistry at the Norwegian University in 1964 for one year before I studied architecture). Chemistry has been my second interest, and in some scale I feel that it is two parts of the same family chemistry = microcosmos architecture = macrocosmos. To try to understand water (molecules) are fascinating, as structure and content for life. But as I am not a scientist I try to understand things more as analogies and patterns. Your list of Water anomalies are especially interesting, and the graphic drawings. ......I have a feeling that it is interesting that the specific capacity (Cp) of water has a minimum at 36 degrees Celcius, and I wonder if this fact has lead to the biological development of our human body temperature, or not ?? (Nature, must have sought for the best function in all its development.... ) ...... Another very fascinating thing to see is the different phases of  molecular vibrations.  It is is just as this great small scale mobility is linked to the great building diversity water has combined with soluble matter. (. ending up with the result of self-reproducing molecules, the diversity of life...) ..... as an analogy, it is funny to think about light passing water ( and glass) with a slower speed than in air, and then it speeds up when through. Perhaps light has the same speed all the time, but it has to bend in curves around the molecules so it looks as if it has a slower speed in water.... as running on open plain and through wood...   .....another fascinaing thing are the &quot;nearness&quot; in scale and dimensions of the visual light spectrum (wave lenghts) and the size of molecules or smallest life building blocks. (visible light from ultraviolet to infrared wavelenght, 400 nm - 700 nm, water molecule ca 0.3 nm, DNA ca 2.5 nm diam., virus ca 50x600 nm) (if I have understood it right). This was just some winding thoughts from an interested fan &amp; www-reader.  sincerely </p>

    <p><strong>Dear Professor   Chaplin</strong>, Thank you very much for creating the   most comprehensible and scientifically veritable site-page about water and its   structure on internet. The content of the site-page of yours is so amazing and   interesting with scientific point of view that I could not be refrained from   writing a comment on it to acquaint western researchers with the hypothesis and   ideas on water structure of Russian scientist Dr. S. V. Zenin, whose points of   views are shared by me &nbsp;on this site-page <a href="http://www.o8ode.ru/article/oleg/" title="opens new site in a pop-up window" rel="nofollow"  target="otherWin1" onclick="newWin('otherWin1')">http://www.o8ode.ru/article/oleg/</a>. According to S.V.Zenin's hypothesis   water represents hierarchy of correct volumetric structures &quot;assosiates&quot;   (clathrates) in which basis lays the cristall like&nbsp; &ldquo;quantum of water &quot;, consisting of 57   imolecules of water which cooperate with each other due to hydrogen bonds in   such a way that 57 molecules of water quantums forming the structure of a   tetrahedron. The tetrahedron in its turn consists of 4 dodecahedrons. 16   quantums of water in their turn forming the structural element consisting of 912   molecules of water so that water on 80 % consists of such elements like those:   15 % - quantums-tetrahedrons and 3 % - classical molecules of water. Thus, the   structure of water is connected with so-called Platone bodies of tetrahedron and   dodecahedron, the form of which is connected to a gold proportion. The nucleus   of oxygen in water molecule also has the form of Platone body of tetrahedron.   Structures of water clusters have been found theoretically, the today's computer   facilities allows to elucidate it. Moreover, the further comparison of   experimentally found and designed data proved, that polymers of water seem to   have that structure which is described above. In 2001 Dr. Stanislav Zenin   together with Dr. B. Polanuer (now in the USA) carried out comprehencible   research of water structure by the methods of refractometry, NMR and high   effective liquid chromatography, by means of which researchers managed to find   out in analysed samples of water clusters of water, which was predicted   theoretically.</p>

    <p><strong>Dear Dr. Chaplin</strong>, Thank you for the very informative website  on water. I wonder about the hydrogen bond. There are  Zundel's and collaborators' studies on absorption of water in the infrared,  which can only be described by protons tunneling between two sites  of the bridge, thus giving rise to a continuous spectrum. This  tunneling is genuinely <br />
      quantum mechanical, it cannot be described by  assuming Born-Oppenheimer approximation. But everybody seems to do so. Of course, going beyond BOA is a tremendous  task, but, in principle, big errors may occur, when you ignore break down of  BOA in calculations. <br />

    <p><strong>Dear Dr Chaplin</strong>, My name is Andrew   Voronkov, I am PhD student of Moscow State University. I read your web page on   water molecules and each of its updates with big interest. My primary interest   is simulation of proteins - for refinement of&nbsp;&nbsp; protein structures I used   molecular dynamics simulations. I've made comparison of implicit GBSA water model with TIP3P   explicit water model and the RMSD was reduced twice against GBSA. I want to try some improved against TIP3P water model, so I have two quesitons: <br />
      1) If we don't   consider computational time (I work on supercomputer) which water model can you   recommend for protein structure refinement and maybe even folding? I concluded   from your review that TIP5P from non polarizable and SWM4-NDP from polarizable   are the most appropriate.</p>
    <p>2) Do you know some groups which develop water models specially   for biomolecules simulations (protein simulations)? I'll be glad to become a   tester for them.</p>

      the subject. My other   concern is the use of chlorine in drinking&nbsp; water. My   own tap water is badly affected by chlorination as my house is first on-line from the holding tank &ndash; the water is undrinkable! I have seen mention of the possibility of chlorine being   destabilised into free radical form. Does this mean   that chlorine has oxidant (or&nbsp; antioxidant) effects in   its ability to neutralise bacteria etc? I have also read of EMR increasing free radical formation. What   would&nbsp; then be the possibility of EMR increasing further   breakdown of&nbsp; chlorine into free radicals in tap   water? I would be most interested to hear your views on the   subject. <br />

    <p><strong>Hi Martin</strong> Many thanks for your prompt reply. Sorry to trouble you again, but living in a rural area our local water contains large amounts of run-off from fields introducing manure and sheep foecal matter etc. I know that the water company then add large amounts of chlorine to kill off this material. Further to what you said can the chlorine free radicals interact sufficiently leaving a lasting effect? If that is the case is it possible that EMR (transformer above holding tank which I can see from my house) can have some detrimental influence? On a personal note I can get stiff neck and headache from drinking our tap water even if well filtered - something odd is happening!</p>

    <p><strong>Hallo Dr. Chaplin</strong>, I appreciate your   site, I work with water from an artistic and technological stand point- particularly around its more subtle qualities around   its structure. You seem to confirm what I've understood   about its tetrahedral structure- but much of the   scientific jargon was beyond me. Is it true from your   research that the molecule holds a tetrahedral structure? For the technology I work with its crucial that we can convey   this point- see my website <a href="http://www.californiaflowforms.org" title="opens new site in a pop-up window" rel="nofollow"  target="otherWin43" onclick="newWin('otherWin43')">www.californiaflowforms.org</a>-   the inventor or our technology lives not far from   you. Also, have you found that different qualities of water (polluted   vs. pure) affect its structure? Our work is closely related to the work of Austrian scientist   Victor Schauberger, I'm curious if you're aware of his   work and what you think of 
      it. I   intend to study your site more and will link it from mine soon. Thank you, <br />

    <p><strong>Dear Prof. Chaplin</strong>, I found your Water Structure and Science site extremely useful.   It is 
      very convenient for us &ndash; readers &ndash; to have such a   complete overview, 
      especially due to astonishing full   reference list. </p>
    <p>I have lead a small scientist group in Joint Institute of   Nuclear 
      Research (Dubna, Russia) for some years. The   base topic of work was to 
      develop a highly precise   radioanalytical technique for studying 
      ultra-diluted   aqueous solutions [1]. Main focus was set on transport 
      phenomena, such as electrophoresis and diffusion of different ions [2, 
      3]. To cut long story short, in our course of investigation we have   found 
      that ions mobility in low acidic water solutions   (pH = 2.5 &ndash; 4.5) show 
      an abnormal high values [4].   Outside this pH region ions mobility has 
      normal   (expected, predicted) values. Note that this effect (so called 
      &ldquo;Abnormal acceleration&rdquo;) take place independently of ions type 
      investigated: cations or anions, simple or complex,   small or large, 
      well- or poor-hydrated. Thus, a solvent   (water) structure should be 
      responsible: there should be   some kind of reversible water structure 
      reordering,   rearrangement at that pH scale &ndash; such to ensure the 
      increase of ions mobility. The abnormal acceleration effect is strange and could not be   explained 
      by any theory at that moment; nevertheless it   does exist. I am very

      to conclusions   of dramatic importance to biochemistry and cell 
      biology. </p>

    <hr />
    <p><strong>Dear Sir</strong>, I think your site is quite wonderful. Although I'm not involved   in any  
      sciences, it doesn't mean science is not of major   interest to me. I enjoy  
      reading such material   extensively, as recreation (to me) - a love of  
      learning.   Water is a fascinating subject &amp; has interested me for many years.  
      It's the &quot;stuff of life&quot;! </p>
    <p>But as interesting &amp; informative as your site is, I can only   read it for a  
      short period of time before my eyes start   spinning in my head.;-) Well, not  
      quite but the colour   of your background in the individual articles is  
      unbearable for me. My head will literally hurt after working to focus on   the  
      text. The deep teal background makes it very hard to   see the black text  
      clearly plus the red hyperlinked   words appear to 'vibrate' or shimmer to me.  
      I'm sure the   unpleasantness of focusing on the words affects my ability to  
      remember what I read as well as I could. </p>
    <p>While the way I perceive the text against such intense colours   may seem highly  
      unusual to you, it's not that uncommon.   A lot of people have this problem -  
      it's called Scotopic   Sensitivity/Irlen Syndrome &amp; it affects the way we view  
      some objects. It's most common in people with autism or Asperger's   syndrome  
      or learning/reading disorders but it can be   found in many others too. Perhaps  
      those of us who don't   seem to have other disorders share some genes in common  
      with those who are autistic. My oldest son (well respected programmer)   has  
      Asperger's so I'm sure there are genes that cause   this problem. </p>
    <p>This is not meant to be critical in a unkind way but meant   constructively.  
      Usually, when I find a site that's   difficult to read, I ignore it &amp; simply  
      find   another. But your site is quite unique. I don't wish to ignore it! I've  
      never bothered to write a site owner before about this   but your site is  
      special - sincerely meant. </p>
    <p>I can do some basic HTML formatting &amp; am almost tempted to   copy the entire  
      source code for your pages &amp; then   reformat them &amp; put them up in my own web  
      site (I   have one that's strictly private &amp; not accessible to the public),  
      simply so I could read them at leisure. But I'm hoping   that my plea will  
      cause you to rethink your web   formatting. If your text was on a neutral light  
      coloured   background, it would be SO much more readable. Is it possible for  
      you to do so, please? My truest gratitude for an   otherwise excellent site! <br />
      sincerely,

    <p><strong>Prof. Chaplin</strong>, 
      If pure liquid water is under modest pressure in a plastic container, say 2 to 5 atmospheres gage, and the temperature is very close to freezing (possibly below 0 C), will ice form if the pressure is suddenly released?  Does this occur because of the small compressibility of water?</p>
    <p>Thank you very much, 
      
      Ronald Vincent</p>
    <p>:-February 29, 2008 5:51:09 PM<br />
      <span class="style13">Martin replies:      It is possible that a small amount could freeze under very tightly controlled conditions due to the pressure lowering the freezing point. However the temperature range for this effect is a tiny fraction of a degree.
      
      It is more likely that the water is supercooled and the release shock causes freezing.
      
      Neither effect is due to the compressibility of water.</span> </p>

    <p>I have a question concerning electrolysis of water. I&rsquo;m conducting a very simple experiment using a combined fuel cell/electrolyzer. First I split the water into H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> using the device as an electrolyzer at app. 1.67 V and 0.3 A. Then I recombine the H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> into water again, where the fuel cell produces electricity and have a toy electromotor run on it. Usually after app. 5 minutes of electrolyzing I have app. 10 cm<sup>3</sup> H<sub>2</sub> and 5 cm<sup>3</sup> O<sub>2</sub>. The toy motor will run about 30 minutes using the device as a fuel cell. So far the process is reproducible every time. However I noticed that the process when I&rsquo;m using the same water over and over again, the fuel cell producing electricity will produce less and less electricity. It seems to me that the reaction of H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> becoming H<sub>2</sub>O again becomes less and less spontaneous. Sometimes the motor only runs for a couple of minutes and then stops completely. However when I disconnect the wires and reconnect them after a couple of minutes it will run again, but only for a short time. Do you have an explanation for this finding or could you give me hint at what might be happening here?   Your answer would greatly appreciated. <br />

    <p class="style13">Dr. R. Dayal Yadav replies: <strong>Dear Prof. Chaplin good morning</strong> -   The  question on 'electrolysis and  again reunion of hydrogen and oxygen leading to less energy output through the electric motor in each cycle of repeated operation on the same bulk of water without detaching the system' speaks volume. This relates to hydrogen-bonding. The weak bond can perform the strongest work when the system is open to assimilate. Here the system is closed and operation is carried out on the same bulk of water. Thus the result. It is similar to wrapping two threads on each other ad recording the reverse sequence afterwards. After few operation the two threads will starts compromising and it is no wonder that after hundreds of operation the thread will look like twisted DNA. However this experiment and observation may be further extended to study the spirit and behavior of humans. We are working on a project that concentrates on molecular behavior of water in isolation.   Regards Dr. R. Dayal Yadav Researcher Study Group DIM<br />

    I am working with freezing of food.   We have seen high-density ice when we treat water with magnetic fields, power.   Do you have any comments? <br />
    &rsquo;C. (Water in a fish fililet.)   We think the magnetic power have influence on the hydrogen bonds in water.   At this level we have a spontaneous and very fast crystallization, and we get an amorphous ice. (We &ldquo;produce&rdquo; a type of under cooled water.)  We call this a verification.   The result is that fish filet after freezing and defrosting, have a quality nearly like fresh fish.    At present time, there is a big drop loss after freezing, and reduced quality.   What do you think about this?<br />

    I believe that the boiling point of water is unexpectedly high due to hydrogen-bonding.  If hydrogen-bonding is reduced by the presence of a chaotrope, wouldn&rsquo;t the boiling point be depressed rather than elevated in the manner normally expected from the presence of a solute? <br />

    :-25 September 2007 00:02:51<br />
    <span class="style13">Martin replies: The effect on boiling point is a <a href="colligative_properties.html">colligative effect</a> dependent on the increase in entropy due to mixing with the solute; both chaotropes and kosmotropes do this.  In a way you are correct in that a kosmotrope has a greater raising effect than a chaotrope if it binds more water.</span>

    It is apparent that microwave radiation can radically alter the &quot;life-giving&quot; characteristics of water, as shown by the failure of seeds to sprout when moistened with water that has been boiled in a microwave oven for a period of minutes. In what way is the structure of water altered by microwaves to give rise to such a fundamental change in its effect on a living organism?
    
    Thank you for your informed attention on this matter, as, web-wise, there is only scoffing at this significant observation--that microwaved water is unusable by plants. (And most probably by other organisms as well.) The scoffing occurs despite the fact that this phenomenon can be quickly verified by simple, easily replicated experiments.<br />

We've been running lots of systems on the Cornell Theory Center supercomputer, in order to extract these critical exponents in 2, 3, 4, and 5 dimensions. Karin Dahmen has been using the renormalization group to predict these exponents as a function of dimension: these theoretical methods converge best near the ``upper critical dimension'', which for our problem is six. After an amazing amount of hard work, we've found great agreement between theory and experiment:</p>
    <p>Now the key phrase here is these theoretical methods converge best near the ``upper critical dimension'', which for our problem is six. Years ago I discovered the PV^6 = a constant equation of state for water and published it in an international conference on materials. A year or two ago I also asked Professor Chaplin to <a href="water_unexpected.html#pd">include the results</a> on his unsurpassed Water website. Unlike the powers (exponents) I had been getting for clays and cemented materials this power was integral. 
      I knew this must be significant but I could never work out what that significance was (not surprising in retrospect since I didn't have the use of the Cornell Theory Centre supercomputer).</p>
    <p>Now, thanks to the Cornell research, the answer is obvious. Water is at the equivalent of the point of failure under compression in concrete. If you invert the well known Volume vs Temperature graph it is the same and the stress-strain curve for concrete at the point of maximum stress. The classic 4&deg; maximum density point corresponds to the maximum stress point on the stress strain curve, in other words the strength. 
      
      Well that's a turn up for the book! And to think that if it hadn't been for this forum and mo giving that reference to the Cornell work, that connection might have remained hidden for another 3 decades.
      
      Water is by far the most important fluid there is. After all, our own bodies are 70% water. Anything which advances our understanding of water and how it works is absolutely vital in a whole variety of research areas.
      
      Anyone here from Cornell?

    Very recently there have been news reports of unexpected large lakes and swift flowing rivers found below the antartic ice &quot;that is kilometers thick in some areas&quot;
    
    From the known phase diagrams of water, the fluid phase can exist to around 10^9 Pascals (with surface air pressure around 105 Pa) with temperatures around 0 degrees C and higher. 
    
    Does the pressure of the &quot;up to a kilometer thick&quot; ice approach the pressure where the liquid phase is excluded? If not, why was the presence of water below the ice not predicted, as the temperature of the continental bedrock is well above 0 degrees? <br />

    <span class="style13">Martin replies: Each kilometer of ice adds about 10 MPa. There is no way the pressure is great enough to turn liquid water to high-pressure ice at about 0&nbsp;&deg;C. Otherwise the ocean deeps would be ice too. </span>

    <b>Hi </b>What is the meaning of the term 'hydrophilic' and how can it be applied in the medical field.                                                                                                            Tell  me the history of ArJmoldes' principle. <br />

    <span class="style13">Martin replies: Hydrophilic literally means 'water-loving'. Molecules, and parts of molecules, that interact strongly with water are termed hydrophilic. The opposite is 'hydrophobic'. You should Google elsewhere for 
    ArJmoldes' principle.</span>
