    <p align="left">Protein folding is driven by its interaction with water as it emerges from ribosomal synthesis into the bulk aqueous phase of the cytoplasm. The folding is very fast, partly because the number of possible conformations is far far lower than that described in the Levinthal paradox [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2608">2608</a><a name="r2608" id="r2608"></a>],<sup><a href="protein_denatured.html#c" name="bc" id="bc">b</a></sup> and mainly because of the guided conformations rapidly found by means of the aqueous interactions. The rearrangement of water around wholly unfolded protein chains releases energy to start the folding process [<a href="ref33.html#r3210" name="r3210" title="go to cited reference" id="r3210">3210</a>]. This particularly involves the hydrophobic interactions, 
       reducing their large surface 
      area  with water which otherwise would cause an unfavorable entropy decrease (mostly translational 
      [<a name="r686" id="r686"></a><a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r686">686</a>a, <a  href="ref16.html#r1577" name="r1577" title="go to cited reference" id="r1577">1577</a>]).&nbsp;Consider a water 
      molecule next to a surface to which it cannot hydrogen-bond. 
      The incompatibility of this surface with the <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">low-density 
      water that forms</a> over such a surface [<a href="ref.html#r29" name="r29" title="go to cited reference" id="r29">29</a>] 
      encourages the surface minimization that drives the proteins' 
      tertiary structure formation (for example, see [<a href="ref14.html#r1312" name="r1312" title="go to cited reference" id="r1312">1312</a>]). An alternative view of this process is that the protein conformation tends to minimize the disruption of the water matrix [<a href="ref21.html#r2037" name="r2037" title="go to cited reference" id="r2037">2037</a>]. Such sequential hydrophobic collapse is 
      necessarily accompanied and guided by (secondary) structural 
      hydrogen-bond formation between favorable peptide linkages 
      in parallel with their desolvation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref5.html#r467">467</a><a name="r467" id="r467"></a>] and the formation of strong ion-paired salt links  [<a href="ref24.html#r2311" name="r2311" title="go to cited reference" id="r2311">2311</a>].<sup><a href="protein_denatured.html#a" name="ba" id="ba">a</a></sup> A driving force for this, in crowded <a href="intracellular_water.html">intracellular 
      environments</a>, is the release of water to be available 
      for the hydration of other solutes and maximizing its entropy [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r686">686</a>b].  Charge-charge interactions, due to molecular crowding inside cells, may slow protein folding. Proteins are not necessarily stabilized inside cells (compared with <em>in vitro</em> studies) but reducing these charge-charge interactions may increase protein stability [<a href="ref25.html#r2495" name="r2495" title="go to cited reference" id="r2495">2495</a>]. The folding route is controlled 
      by the desolvation barriers [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r676">676</a><a name="r676" id="r676"></a>] 
      plus charge-charge interactions and aided and directed by water-mediated contacts zipping up neighboring residues [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1417">1417</a><a name="r1417" id="r1417"></a>]. An  additional factor is reducing the aqueous sheath surrounding the growing  polypeptide chain by folding into secondary structures, releasing water to  hydrate elsewhere  [<a href="ref23.html#r2288" name="r2288" title="go to cited reference" id="r2288">2288</a>]. Similar 
      factors help organize proteins involved in quaternary and 
      equilibrium cluster formation, where each water-mediated interaction 
      has been estimated to contribute an average of 4.4 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> to protein-protein interface stabilization [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r688">688</a><a name="r688" id="r688"></a>]. 
      Water is thus intimately involved in guiding protein folding 
      as the protein is synthesized and needs to be included in the structural prediction 
      of protein [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r643">643</a><a name="r643" id="r643"></a>]. 
      The importance of subtle hydration forces is shown in the &alpha;-helix to &beta;-sheet 
      conformational transition that accompanies the racemic self-assembly 
      of polylysine [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref8.html#r727">727</a><a name="r727" id="r727"></a>].</p>

<p>Opposite is shown schematic  potential energy funnel for the folding of proteins without sufficient water present. It highlights the many  barriers to the preferred minimum energy structure on the folding pathway.  Numerous local minima might trap the protein in an inactive  three-dimensional molecular conformations. The top rim  represents the high energy of the unfolded protein with folding, lowering the  energy towards a minimum energy structure  at the bottom of the funnel.  It should be noted that these funnels represent three-dimensional landscapes,  whereas the actual energy landscapes are multidimensional.</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>The unfolded states of most foldable sequences are expanded in water, even if they are quite hydrophobic  [<a  href="ref31.html#r3066" name="r3066" title="go to cited reference" id="r3066">3066</a>]. Thus, when a protein is  fully hydrated, the potential energy landscape is seen to be considerably smoother.<sup><a href="protein_denatured.html#a">a</a></sup> Under conditions of sufficient hydration, this  allows proteins to attain their active minimum-energy conformation in a  straightforward and rapid manner. The potential energy barriers are lowered and smoothed due to the ease with which water molecules can lubricate the movement of the amino acid backbone and side groups by the rapid formation and exchange of hydrogen bonds. The amino-acid side-chains also facilitate this process by reducing the hydration of peptide groups (a shielding effect) that promotes  protein folding   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3090">3090</a><a name="r3090" id="r3090"></a>].</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>Similar effects may be seen in the activity of enzymes with hydration  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref9.html#r822">822</a><a name="r822" id="r822"></a>], although complete hydration is unnecessary for some activity to be evident. Under physiological conditions inside cells, the water is known to be more ordered (see <a title="go to 'Intracellular water' page" href="intracellular_water.html">intracellular water</a>). Such water promotes both the folding rate and stability of the protein [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1250">1250</a><a name="r1250" id="r1250"></a>] even further.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Although indicated as such in the cartoons, there is no one 'minimum' structure but a collection of substates, with small energetic differences. Jumps between these substates, eased by hydration, allow and determine the flexibility that the protein needs for its biological actions.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Incorporating water-mediated interactions in the folding process has allowed protein structure prediction from the sequence data [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2782">2782</a><a name="r2782" id="r2782"></a>]. </p>

        This explains the increased structural instability of

        to the &alpha;-helix - &beta;-sheet

      <p>Although the native state of a protein resides

        reason to suppose that this structure is the global minimum 
        free energy structure as its folding route is a guided, rather 
        than random, process. It is clear that other structures with lower minima exist, such as those often irreversibly produced on denaturation, for example on heating followed by cooling, which utilizes other intermolecular interactions  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1152">1152</a><a name="r1152" id="r1152"></a>].</p>

    <p align="left">Many proteins are glycosylated with increased solubility. The role of the carbohydrate groups has been debated for many years. It now appears that this increased solubility  is mainly as the low intermolecular interaction between surface glycans reduces the tendency for aggregation (and crystallization) rather than the glycan groups increasing the interactions with water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1164">1164</a><a name="r1164" id="r1164"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2104">2104</a><a name="r2104" id="r2104"></a>]. Somewhat unexpectedly, deglycosylated proteins appear to have a stronger interaction with water (by weight) and more extensive water-binding (by molecule) than their glycoproteins [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1164">1164</a>]; perhaps because some carbohydrate hydroxyl groups replace several of the polypeptide surface water interactions.

    <p>Proteins may form crystals when <a title="go to find more on salting out" href="hofmeister_series.html#b">precipitated</a> slowly  from an aqueous solution (e.g., of ammonium sulfate). Slow precipitation is required to produce small numbers of larger crystals rather than very large numbers of tiny crystals. Crystals of undenatured proteins for structural analysis are best formed with water molecules retained within the crystal lattice. Crystallization of native proteins appears to have a three-step mechanism involving nucleation, in which mesoscopic metastable protein clusters of dense liquid serve as precursors to the ordered crystal nuclei followed by crystal growth [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1800">1800</a><a name="r1800" id="r1800"></a>].

    <p>Protein denaturation involves a change in the protein structure (generally an unfolding) with activity  loss. It has been described using the small protein, hen egg-white lysozyme  
    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2545">2545</a><a name="r2545" id="r2545"></a>]. Water is critical, not only for the correct folding of proteins 
    but also for the maintenance of this structure. Heat denaturation 
    and loss of biological activity have been linked to the breakup 
    of the 2-D-spanning water network (see above) around the protein 
    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1215">1215</a><a name="r1215" id="r1215"></a>] (due to increased  breakage of the hydrogen bonds with temperature), 
    which otherwise acts restrictively on protein vibrational 
    dynamics [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref10.html#r976">976</a><a name="r976" id="r976"></a>]. 
    As proteins denature, their structures initially become looser, allowing them to take up more water with the water-exposed surface increasing by up to 50% [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2803">2803</a><a name="r2803" id="r2803"></a>] as might be expected from reversing protein folding. It is a cooperative process (see right) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2200">2200</a><a name="r2200" id="r2200"></a>]. The free energy change on folding or unfolding is due to the 
    combined effects of protein folding/unfolding and hydration 
    changes  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref41.html#r4036">4036</a><a name="r4036" id="r4036"></a>]. These compensate to such a large extent that the 
    free energy of stability of a typical protein is only 40-90 
    kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> (equivalent to very few hydrogen bonds), 
    whereas the enthalpy change (and temperature times the entropy 
    change) may be greater than &plusmn;500 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> different. There are both enthalpic and entropic contributions 
    to this free energy that  change with temperature and  give 
    rise to heat denaturation and, in some cases, cold denaturation. 
    Protein unfolding  at higher temperatures (heat denaturation) is easily understood.  However, the widespread existence of protein unfolding at low temperatures 
    is surprising, particularly as it is unexpectedly accompanied 
    by a decrease in entropy [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref5.html#r416">416</a><a name="r416" id="r416"></a>]. Heat denaturation is endothermic (on heating), but cold denaturation is exothermic (on cooling) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1548">1548</a><a name="r1548" id="r1548"></a>]. Cold denaturation occurs only in aqueous solutions due to water's anomalous density behavior and the small size of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2253">2253</a><a name="r2253" id="r2253"></a>].
    There is a cold-denaturation of proteins at the ice-water interface due to the lowering of the unfolding free-energy barrier [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3906">3906</a><a name="r3906" id="r3906"></a>]. Surprisingly, at even lower temperatures (&lt;194 K), proteins may return to the folded state due to the desolvation of their hydrophobic core [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref44.html#r4343">4343</a><a name="r4343" id="r4343"></a>].</p>

The extra thermal stability of globular proteins from thermophilic microorganisms,  relative to proteins from mesophilic microorganisms, is likely due to the protein structure being such that it decreases the conformational entropy gain associated with denaturation [<a href="ref30.html#r2975" name="r2975" title="go to cited reference" id="r2975">2975</a>]. </p>

      <p>Yeast frataxin, a protein involved in the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters, has been observed in both cold and hot denatured states  at 272 K and 323 K, respectively  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2780">2780</a><a name="r2780" id="r2780"></a>]. In the cold denatured state, the water has more hydrogen bonds (3.77 rather than 3.66 mol &#739; mol <sup>&minus;1</sup>), but -4.54 kJ &#739; mol <sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; K <sup>&minus;1</sup> entropy loss, the protein-water interface gains energy of -2900 kJ &#739; mol <sup>&minus;1</sup> but loses the rotational energy of 347 water molecules &#739; mol <sup>&minus;1</sup> protein net and the protein loses +919 kJ &#739; mol <sup>&minus;1</sup> but gains the entropy of 8 main microstates. In the hot denatured state, the water has fewer hydrogen bonds (3.55 mol &#739; mol <sup>&minus;1</sup>) but +3.67 kJ &#739; mol <sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; K <sup>&minus;1</sup> entropy gain, the protein-water interface loses energy of +137 kJ &#739; mol <sup>&minus;1</sup>. However, it  loses the rotational energy of 233 water molecules &#739; mol <sup>&minus;1</sup> protein net, and the protein loses +481 kJ &#739; mol <sup>&minus;1</sup> but gains the entropy of 15 main microstates [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2780">2780</a>]. These results suggest that proteins do not lose hydrogen bonds with respect to bulk water  but mostly lose their rotational entropy due to greater exposed surfaces.</p>

<p>The midpoint temperatures of both heat and cold denaturation 
      may be determined from peaks in the temperature dependence 
      of the heat capacity, where the intermediate structures  absorb the additional heat.  The temperature range is relatively narrow (&asymp; 15&nbsp;&deg;C) with the &lsquo;&lsquo;melting temperature&rsquo;&rsquo; (T<sub>m</sub> ), of the protein defined as the midpoint of the unfolding transition, where the Gibbs free energy of unfolding, &Delta;G<sub>u</sub> = 0. The unfolding is due to the competition between the enthalpy of the hydrogen bonding between amino acid residues and the hydration of amino acid residues. The extent of the effect of<a href="kosmotropes_chaotropes.html"> kosmotropic and chaotropic</a> solutes on protein stability has been found to depend on the <a href="water_activity.html">water activity</a> (a<sub>w</sub>).  For example, the melting point of ribonuclease at pH 5.5 (60&nbsp;&deg;C) increases with rising kosmotropic trehalose content (and consequent reduction in a<sub>w</sub>) whereas with the chaotropic molecule urea, the melting point reduces with increasing urea content (and consequent reduction in a<sub>w</sub>) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref28.html#r2732">2732</a><a name="r2732" id="r2732"></a>].

      <p><br />
</p>
      <p>The enthalpy of transfer of polar groups from the protein 
        interior into water is positive at low temperatures and negative 
        at higher temperatures [<a href="ref2.html#r150" name="r150" title="go to cited reference" id="r150">150</a>]. 
        This is due to the polar groups creating their own ordered 
        water, which generates a negative enthalpy change due to the 
        increased molecular interactions. Balanced against this is 
        the positive enthalpy change as the pre-existing water structure 
        and the polar interactions within the protein both have to 
        be broken. As water naturally has more structure at lower 
        temperatures, the breakdown of the water structure makes a 
        significant positive contribution to the overall enthalpy at lower 
        temperatures.&nbsp;<a title="go to top of page" href="protein_denatured.html#top"><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a></p>
</div>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In contrast, the enthalpy of transfer of nonpolar groups 
      from the protein interior into water is negative below about 
      25&nbsp;&deg;C and positive above [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref2.html#r150">150</a>]. 
      At lower temperatures, nonpolar groups enhance pre-existing 
      order, such as the clathrate-related <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES"><abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure">ES</abbr></a> structure [<a href="ref3.html#r270" name="r270" title="go to cited reference" id="r270">270</a>], discussed <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html">elsewhere</a>, generating enthalpy. However, this effect is lost with increasing temperature, as any 
      pre-existing order is also lost. At higher temperatures, the 
      creation of these clathrate structures requires an enthalpic 
      input. Thus, there is an overall positive enthalpy of unfolding 
      at higher temperatures. An equivalent but alternative way 
      of describing this process is that at lower temperatures, the 
      clathrate-type structure optimizes its multiple <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> molecular interactions, whereas at higher temperatures such 
      favorable structuring is no longer available.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At ambient temperature, the entropies of hydration of both 
      nonpolar and polar groups are negative [<a href="ref2.html#r151" name="r151" title="go to cited reference" id="r151">151</a>], 
      indicating that both create order in the aqueous environment. 
      However, these entropies differ with respect to how they change 
      with increasing temperature. The entropy of hydration of nonpolar 
      groups increases through zero with increasing temperature, 
      indicating that they are less able to order the water at higher 
      temperatures and may, indeed, contribute to its disorder by 
      interfering with the extent of the hydrogen-bonded network 
      and allowing an easier molecular rotation of water. Also, 
      there is an entropy gain from the greater freedom of the nonpolar 
      groups when the protein is unfolded. In contrast, the entropy 
      of hydration of polar groups decreases, becoming more negative 
      with increasing temperature, as they can create ordered 
      hydration shells even from the more disordered water that 
      exists at higher temperatures. Consequently,  the water is more ordered around hydrophilic groups, compared with just water, as the temperature is raised and that this hydrophilic hydration has negative heat capacity [<a  href="ref16.html#r1578" name="r1578" title="go to cited reference" id="r1578">1578</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Overall, protein stability depends on the balance between 
      these enthalpic and entropic changes. For globular proteins, 
      the &Delta;G of unfolding has a maximum 
      10-30&nbsp;&deg;C, decreasing both colder and hotter through zero 
      with the thermodynamic consequences of both cold and heat 
      denaturation. The hydration of the internal nonpolar groups 
      is mainly responsible for cold denaturation as their energy 
      of hydration is greatest when cold. Thus,  the increased natural structuring of water at lower temperatures causes cold  destabilization of proteins in solution (that is, the entropic cost of  denaturation, due to the structuring of the water molecules around the exposed  groups, is reduced)   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1371">1371</a><a name="r1371" id="r1371"></a>]. 
      An equivalent alternative view is that the <a title="go to a new page for more information" href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">hydrophobic interactions</a> increase as the temperature is raised from a low value, such that the extended polypeptide chain, present at very low temperatures,  folds up to produce an active globular protein so releasing water molecules to the bulk environment.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Heat denaturation is primarily due to the increased entropic 
      effects of the nonpolar residues (that is, the increased 
      entropy gain of the unfolded chain is not much reduced by 
      the small amount of entropy loss caused to the solute). Although 
      both processes have been reported to lead to irreversible 
      changes, which often occur cooperatively, cold inactivation 
      in supercooled water is usually likely to be reversible. 
      It is  ice crystal formation that leads to observed irreversible 
      effects. Interestingly, proteins from thermophilic microorganisms 
      tend to have higher amounts of nonpolar residues and lower 
      amounts of polar residues  compared to comparable proteins 
      from mesophilic organisms [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref10.html#r982">982</a><a name="r982" id="r982"></a>]. 
      This is related to decreased bound water around thermophilic enzymes in crystals and solution [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1291">1291</a><a name="r1291" id="r1291"></a>] as part of their strategy for stability 
      (other factors being increased salt bridges and main chain 
      hydrogen bonds) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref10.html#r982">982</a>]. However, such  thermophilic enzymes may be stabilized by internal buried structural water molecules [<a  href="ref25.html#r2422" name="r2422" title="go to cited reference" id="r2422">2422</a>]. It was noted in 1978 that smaller globular proteins had higher denaturation temperatures [<a  href="ref41.html#r4019" name="r4019" title="go to cited reference" id="r4019">4019</a>]. Such smaller proteins show a smaller denaturation entropy change than might have been expected [<a  href="ref41.html#r4018" name="r4018" title="go to cited reference" id="r4018">4018</a>],  leading to an increase in the denaturation temperature. This is proposed due to their large surface-to-interior ratio leading to a decrease in the conformational entropy gain associated with heat-induced denaturation.    </p>

The diagram is related to the pressure-temperature relationship of the <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#Pexpan">thermal expansion of water</a> [<a href="ref15.html#r1481" title="go to cited reference">1481</a>]. The pressure denaturation is accompanied by a significantly large gain of water entropy [<a href="ref39.html#r3870" name="r3870" title="go to cited reference" id="r3870">3870</a>]. Thermophilic proteins are generally also  more stable with respect to pressure [<a href="ref30.html#r2974" name="r2974" title="go to cited reference" id="r2974">2974</a>]. They possess slightly greater hydrophilic surfaces than mesophilic proteins and much more  hydrophilic surfaces than ice-binding proteins. These differences between thermophilic and mesophilic protein structures are slight, as too extensive a hydrophilic surface leads to  a reduced  stability range in both temperature and pressure, due to poorly balanced interactions with water [<a href="ref30.html#r2974" title="go to cited reference" >2974</a>]. The diagram (above right; mouse over for thermodynamics) represents the solubility of other polymers, such as <a title="go to find more information" href="starch.html">starch</a> and the aggregation of nonpolar solutes [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref20.html#r1959">1959</a><a name="r1959" id="r1959"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Denaturation may be effectively treated as an increased

    <p>The effect of

      may be understood by recognizing that extremes of pH cause 
      an increase in higher density clustering which may be partially 
      reversed by the presence of <a href="kosmotropes_chaotropes.html" title="more on kosmotropes and chaotropes">non-ionic

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">There is a change in volume with denaturation (<img src="images/dv.gif" width="34" height="24" align="absmiddle" alt="dV" />) 
      varying with the protein concerned but typically from negative (i.e., the overall volume of water and protein is smaller 
      on denaturation) at low temperatures to slightly positive 
      at high temperatures. This is due to the released nonpolar 
      residues producing less-dense water (for example, <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES"><abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure">ES</abbr></a>) 
      at low temperatures but less able to do this at high temperatures. 
      Whereas, the released polar groups cause a greater increase 
      in density at low temperatures, due to their destruction of 
      the low-density water, than at high temperatures, where there 
      is less destroyable low-density water. A small pressure increase 
      may reduce the size of proteins due to reduced hydrogen bond length  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2324">2324</a><a name="r2324" id="r2324"></a>], but stabilize the protein against both cold and heat denaturation. 
      At low temperatures, a small pressure increase reduces the 
      size of the enthalpic contribution of nonpolar group hydration 
      due to the reduced aqueous structuring. At high temperatures, 
      the enthalpic cost of hydrating these nonpolar groups is 
      increased when under a small pressure increase, and this may help the increased thermal stability of proteins seen in crowded environments [<a href="ref11.html#r1052">1052</a><a name="r1052" id="r1052"></a>]. Under higher 
      pressure, proteins take up water into empty cavities  [<a href="ref20.html#r1940">1940</a><a name="r1940" id="r1940"></a>]. This 
      penetrating water eases the process of denaturation by destabilizing 
      the internal links. The negative volume change at higher pressures, due to cavity filling, 
      helps shift the enthalpy change in favor of denaturation across 
      the temperature range but has been particularly noted at low temperatures, in line with the <a title="go to Figure" href="protein_denatured.html#denatfig">Figure above</a> (for further discussion, see [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref9.html#r847">847</a><a name="r847" id="r847"></a>]). Notwithstanding the destabilization of proteins at high pressure (due to water ingress, as above), individual helices may be stabilized due to their smaller total volume (water + helix) compared to their denatured structure [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2279">2279</a><a name="r2279" id="r2279"></a>]. High pressures strongly increase the roughness of the free energy landscape of the system (see <a href="protein_denatured.html#landscape">above</a>) as it compacts the structure without significantly affecting the magnitude of the energy states [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3198">3198</a><a name="r3198" id="r3198"></a>].</p>

    <h2><a name="b" id="b"></a> Prions</h2>

The term prions itself was first coined in 1982 by Stanley B. Prusiner<sup><a href="protein_denatured.html#d" name="bd" id="bd">c</a></sup>, an  American scientist who  for two decades struggled to convince his peers that  certain proteins were possibly responsible for various unusual brain diseases,  which in medical terms are called spongiform encephalopathies. Prusiner was  later in 1997 presented with the Nobel prize in medicine. Prion proteins are, as stated in their  name, protein molecules and have no nucleic acid genetic information. Instead, the  proteins are made up of amino acids, which due to a defect, subsequently  direct the prion protein to fold into fibrils in a dysfunctional manner which then aggregates [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3142">3142</a><a name="r3142" id="r3142"></a>]. This abnormal  folding occurs when the normal mainly-helical PrP<sup>c</sup> protein refolds to form an  abnormal PrP<sup>sc</sup> protein with a substantial &beta;-sheet substructure (see below right). </p>

    <p>Each and every protein, when activated,  folds in a specific way; prion proteins are no different. When an abnormal PrP<sup>sc</sup> protein folds, it folds in an unusual way, adversely affecting the neuronal cells. The PrP<sup>sc</sup> protein then attaches to other  healthy PrP<sup>c</sup> proteins, building a template that changes the normal conformation of  the healthy prion protein to that of the disease-causing  highly stable proteins   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3142">3142</a>]. </p>        
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This continual cycle occurs until the  neuronal cell dies and disperses the infectious prion protein to surrounding  brain cells, ultimately  leading to&nbsp; brain damage. </p>

    <p>Prion fibril formation has  been explained  as due to the increase of water trimers and hydrophobicity of the Mn-linked (as opposed to the normal Cu-linked) protein in solution. [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1614">1614</a><a name="r1614" id="r1614"></a>].  Water release has an important effect on the rate of initial fibril formation  due to the slow rate with which it is expelled from the hydrophilic amide side chains [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1838">1838</a><a name="r1838" id="r1838"></a>]. Similar filamentous &beta;-amyloid aggregates are crucial for the pathology of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, where simulations suggest that  the fibril assembly involves collective water motions driving the transition from monomer to fibril. These first involve water pools efficiently binding the fibril fragments over a distance of about 3 nm before this water is removed, guiding the  creation of a dry binding interface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2579">2579</a><a name="r2579" id="r2579"></a>].    The gain in entropy of the escaping water molecules compensates for the increased entropy at the new dry surface.</p>

    <p><sup>a<a name="a" id="a"></a> </sup>Correct folding is also aided by the molecular chaperones (chaperonins) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref11.html#r1047">1047</a><a name="r1047" id="r1047"></a>]. The chaperones both increase the density and hydration of the water surrounding the misfolded protein to drive correct re-folding [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1483">1483</a>a<a name="r1483" id="r1483"></a>] and  screen out the  solvent, so allowing only a limited amount of water molecules to be in a chaperone cavity and leading to dehydration of interior of protein  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1483">1483</a>b].

    <p><sup>b<a name="c" id="c"></a></sup> In 1969, Cyrus Levinthal gave a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110523080407/http://www-miller.ch.cam.ac.uk/levinthal/levinthal.html"  title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin2" onclick="newWin('otherWin2')">talk</a> that noted that a protein with N amino acids should have 10<sup>2N</sup> degrees of freedom. Thus a small protein (e.g., 150 amino acids) would have 10<sup>300</sup> degrees of freedom. There is not enough time in the Universe to try each of these combinations, yet the protein is folded within a second. This is known as Levinthal's paradox and has been reviewed  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3362">3362</a><a name="r3362" id="r3362"></a>].
