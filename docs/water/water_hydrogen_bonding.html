    <h2><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Water, with proteins and nucleic acids, is amongst the most important hydrogen-bonded substances. Hydrogen-bonding  forms in liquid water as the hydrogen atoms of one water molecule are attracted towards the oxygen atom of a neighboring water molecule; generally, a proton is shared by two lone electron pairs. In a <a href="h2o_molecule.html">water molecule</a> (H<sub>2</sub>O), 
      the oxygen nucleus with +8 charges attracts electrons 
      better than the hydrogen nucleus with its +1 charge. Hence, 
      the oxygen atom is partially negatively charged, and the 
      hydrogen atom is partially positively charged. The hydrogen bond O-H&middot;&middot;&middot;O may involve a wide range of bonding energies (4 - 120 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>, 0.7 - 20 <a href="constants.html#unit">z</a>J  &#739; molecule<sup>&minus;1</sup> &equiv; 35 - 1000 &nbsp;cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and O&middot;&middot;&middot;O contacts (0.238 to 0.300 nm). The hydrogen 
      atoms are not only covalently attached to their oxygen 
      atoms but also attracted towards other nearby oxygen atoms. 
      This attraction is the basis of the 'hydrogen' bonds. Hydrogen bonding causes the collective ground state of liquid water to have  an energy lower than the ground state found in single gaseous molecules.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> <img class="floatleft" src="images/watere_dimer_2.gif" title="Typical hydrogen bond" alt="hydrogen bonding: H2O---H-OH dimer" width="300" height="135" />The water hydrogen bond is weak, never stronger than 
      about a twentieth of the strength of the O-H covalent bond. 
      It is strong enough, however, to be mostly maintained during thermal 
      fluctuations at and below ambient temperatures.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html#a">a</a><a name="ba" id="ba"></a></sup> The three atoms are not  constantly associated as the hydrogen atoms continuously exchange (timescale ~ ms) between neighboring water molecules due to <a href="water_dissociation.html">protonation/ deprotonation processes</a>. As the hydrogen bond in water is neither too weak nor too strong, it is sometimes regarded as having &ldquo;Goldilocks&rdquo; strength. The importance of this intermediate strength hydrogen bond is examined in depth within the '<a href="water_life.html">Water and Life</a>' page.    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The hydrogen bond strength in water has  a very broad distribution due to thermal fluctuations and a disparity between the first and second donor (or acceptor) strengths to individual water molecules. The lifetime of a single hydrogen bond is very short (&asymp;  0.1 ps at 100&nbsp;&deg;C; &asymp;  1 ps at 0&nbsp;&deg;C; &asymp;  20 ps at -20&nbsp;&deg;C;  dependent on its definition). This is due to the large amplitude librations of the light hydrogen atoms that take  them away from where the hydrogen bond attraction is high.  Such broken hydrogen bonds will often simply re-form. In liquid water, water molecules are connected within an extended dynamical hydrogen-bonded network, with the individual hydrogen bonds vary between being shorter, straighter and stronger and longer, bent, and weaker. They may even be broken for very brief periods of time (&lt; 100 fs). The vibrational lifetimes of the O-H stretch of H<sub>2</sub>O and HOD in D<sub>2</sub>0 are 0.23 ps and 0.72 ps, respectively, whereas the vibrational lifetimes of the H-O-H bend of H<sub>2</sub>O in H<sub>2</sub>O or D<sub>2</sub>O are 0.17 - 0.27 ps. Due to its hydrogen bonding, the stretch and bend vibrations of water are related [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4139">4139</a><a name="r4139" id="r4139"></a>]. The relationship between the stretch and ben vibrations for water (see plot right) is, </p>
    <p align="center">&omega;<sub>str</sub> &minus; &omega;<sub>str</sub><sup>g</sup> = (&omega;<sub>bend</sub><sup>g</sup>  &minus; &omega;<sub>bend</sub>)/0.2583</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>where &omega;<sub>str</sub><sup>g</sup> and &omega;<sub>bend</sub><sup>g</sup> are the stretch (3706 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and bend (1590.4 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) frequencies of the gas phase. The water bending mode provides a window into the microscopic structure of both bulk and interfacial water.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The attraction 
      of the O-H bonding electrons towards the oxygen atom leaves 
      a deficiency on the far side of the hydrogen atom relative 
      to the oxygen atom. The result is that the attractive force 
      between the O-H hydrogen and the O-atom of a nearby water 
      molecule is strongest when the three atoms are  close to a straight 
      line 
      and when the O-atoms are closer than 0.3 nm. In bulk water at any instant, it is expected that strong tetrahedrally-placed hydrogen bonds form a network (mesh) stretching throughout the liquid which delivers the water's physical properties, plus a smaller amount of isolated pockets of weakly or broken hydrogen-bonded water molecules [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2695">2695</a><a name="r2695" id="r2695"></a>].</p>

    <p align="left">Each water molecule can form two hydrogen bonds involving 
      its hydrogen atoms plus two further hydrogen bonds utilizing 
      the hydrogen atoms attached to neighboring water molecules. 
      These four hydrogen bonds optimally arrange themselves 
      tetrahedrally around each three-atom water molecule as found in ordinary 
      ice (see right). In liquid water, thermal energy bends and stretches 
      and sometimes breaks these hydrogen bonds. However, the 
      'average' structure of a water molecule is similar to 
      this tetrahedral arrangement and endows water with its high cohesiveness. The diagram  shows 
      such a typical 'average' cluster of five water molecules. 
      In the <a href="ice_phases.html">ices,</a> this tetrahedral clustering is extensive, producing 
      crystalline forms. In liquid water, the tetrahedral 
      clustering is only locally found and reduces with increasing 
      temperature. However, hydrogen-bonded chains still connect 
      liquid water molecules separated by large distances.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is a balance between the strength of the hydrogen bonds 
      and the linearity that strong hydrogen bonds impose on the 
      local structure. The stronger the bonds, the more ordered 
      and static is the resultant structure. The energetic cost 
      of the disorder is proportional to the temperature, being 
      smaller at lower temperatures. This is why the structure of 
      liquid water is more ordered at low temperatures. This increase 
      in orderliness in water as the temperature is lowered is far 
      greater than in other liquids due to the strength and preferred 
      direction of the hydrogen bonds and is the primary reason 
      for water's rather unusual properties. [<a title="go to top of page" href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>
    <h2><a name="str" id="str"></a>Water hydrogen bonds</h2>
    
    <p>In liquid water, all water molecules have at least one hydrogen bond to neighboring water molecules with effectively no free water molecules  under ambient conditions (i.e., 'free' molecules with no hydrogen bonds). Also, no isolated molecules exist more than 0.32 nm from any other molecule. Many hydrogen-bonded clusters can be found fleetingly within the liquid matrix, including those found in the ices [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref41.html#r4040">4040</a><a name="r4040" id="r4040"></a>]. There are two main hypotheses concerning the hydrogen bonding of liquid water that divide water science. Either (a) water forms  an effectively continuous three-dimensional network with the hydrogen bonds more or less distorted from their ideal three-dimensional structures, or (b) water consists primarily of a mixture of clusters of water molecules with different degrees of hydrogen-bonding in an equilibrium. Many properties of water are more easily explained using the latter model, which is also supported by several experimental methods. These clusters dynamically connect to each other such that both hypotheses are correct.</p>

    <p> Water molecules in solid  and low-temperature liquid water are exceptional, amongst hydrogen-bonding molecules, having approximately twice as many hydrogen bonds as  covalent bonds around each molecule and averaging as many hydrogen bonds as  covalent bonds. Shown left is the number of hydrogen bonds around each water molecule as the temperature rises with the line-width showing the approximate disparity between different experimental methods (data from [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2264">2264</a><a name="r2264" id="r2264"></a>]). Although there are reports of water surrounded by more than four hydrogen bonds (for example, 5 or 6), these hydrogen bonds cannot be spatially accommodated around the central water molecule, without being sited significantly further from the central oxygen (see below), plus with one or more of the original four hydrogen bonds being substantially weakened. <a name="h205m" id="h205m"></a></p>

If the 
      hydrogen bond energy is determined from the excess heat capacity

    <p align="left">Water's hydrogen bonding holds water molecules  up to about 15% closer than if water was a simple liquid with just van der Waals dispersion interactions. However, as hydrogen bonding is directional, it restricts the number of neighboring water molecules to about four rather than the greater number found in simple liquids (for example, xenon atoms have twelve nearest neighbors in the liquid state. The formation of hydrogen bonds between water molecules gives 
      rise to large but mostly compensating, energetic changes 
      in enthalpy (becoming more negative) and entropy (becoming 
      less positive). Both changes are particularly large, based 
      by a per-mass or a per-volume basis, due to the small size of 
      the water molecule. This enthalpy-entropy compensation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3476">3476</a><a name="r3476" id="r3476"></a>] <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html#h">c</a><a name="bh" id="bh"></a></sup> is 
      almost complete, however, with the consequence that minimal 
      imposed enthalpic or entropic effects may exert a considerable 
      influence on aqueous systems.  It is possible that hydrogen bonds between <a  title="click for an explanation" href="ortho_para_water.html"><em>para</em>-H<sub>2</sub>O</a>, possessing no ground-state spin,   are more  robust stronger and last longer than hydrogen bonds between <a  title="click for an explanation" href="ortho_para_water.html"><em>ortho</em>-H<sub>2</sub>O</a> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1150">1150</a><a name="r1150" id="r1150"></a>]. </p>

The movement of electrons from the oxygen atom to the O-H antibonding orbital on a neighboring molecule (HO-H<sup>&delta;-</sup>&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;<sup>&delta;+</sup>OH<sub>2</sub>) both weaken the covalent O-H bond (so lengthening it ) and reduces the HO-H&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;OH<sub>2</sub> 'hydrogen' bond. hydrogen bonding affects all the molecular orbitals, even including the inner O1s (<a href="h2o_orbitals.html" title="click for an explanation" >1<em>a</em><sub>1</sub></a>) orbital, which is bound 318 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> (3.3 <a href="constants.html#eV">eV</a>)  less strongly in a tetrahedrally hydrogen-bonded bulk liquid phase compared to the gas phase [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1227">1227</a><a name="r1227" id="r1227"></a>].</p>

The ~50% probability for the O&middot;&middot;&middot;O distance is 2.7 &Aring; to 3.1 &Aring;. As the covalent bond lengths vary much less 
        with temperature and pressure, most of the densification of

        be due to a reduction in the hydrogen bond length. This hydrogen

    <h2>Water hydrogen bond direction</h2>
    <p>An essential feature of the hydrogen bond is that it possesses 
      direction; by convention, this direction is that of the shorter 
      O-H (<img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" />) covalent bond 
      (the O-H hydrogen atom being donated to the O-atom acceptor 
      atom on another H<sub>2</sub>O molecule). <a name="nmr" id="nmr"></a> In <abbr title="proton nuclear magnetic resonance"><sup>1</sup>H-NMR</abbr> studies, the chemical shift of the proton involved in the 
      hydrogen bond moves about 0.01 <a href="constants.html#ppm">ppm</a>      &#739;  K<sup>&minus;1</sup> upfield 
      to lower frequency (plus about 5.5 <a href="constants.html#ppm">ppm</a> further upfield to 
      vapor at 100&nbsp;&deg;C). It becomes more shielded with <a href="water_unexpected.html#enthvap"  title="click for an explanation">reducing strength of hydrogen-bonding</a> [<a href="ref3.html#r222" name="r222" title="go to cited reference" id="r222">222</a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref20.html#r1935">1935</a><a name="r1935" id="r1935"></a>] 
      as the temperature is raised. A similar effect may be seen 
      in water's <sup>17</sup>O NMR, moving about 0.05 <a href="constants.html#ppm">ppm</a>       &#739; K<sup>&minus;1</sup> upfield plus 36-38 ppm further upfield to vapor at 100&nbsp;&deg;C. <a name="b" id="b"></a> Unfortunately, this is difficult 
      to use as a tool, however, due to the averaging of the shift 
      and the complexity of the system. The spin-lattice relaxation 
      times (<em>T</em><sub>1</sub>, &asymp; 3.6 s, 25&nbsp;&deg;C) of the water 
      protons are also a function of the hydrogen bonding, being 
      shorter for stronger bonding. The effect of solutes, however, 
      shows the chemical shift and spin-lattice relaxation time 
      are not correlated, as solutes may reduce the extent of hydrogen 
      bonding at the same time as increasing its strength [<a href="ref3.html#r281" name="r281" title="go to cited reference" id="r281">281</a>].&nbsp;The spin-lattice relaxation time has been found to be two or three times greater than the spin-spin relaxation time, suggesting the presence of supramolecular structuring in the water [<a href="ref17.html#r1664" name="r1664" title="go to cited reference" id="r1664">1664</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The increased extent of hydrogen-bonding within clusters results 
      in a similar effect; that is, higher NMR chemical shifts 
      with greater cooperativity [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref5.html#r436">436</a><a name="r436" id="r436"></a>], shorter hydrogen-bonded O-H&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;O distances [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1616">1616</a><a name="r1616" id="r1616"></a>], smaller atomic volume of the hydrogen atom, greater positive charge on the hydrogen atoms and greater negative charge on the oxygen atoms. 
      The bond strength depends on its length and angle, with the strongest hydrogen-bonding in water existing in the short linear proton-centered <a title="go for structure" href="hydrogen_ions.html#h5o2">H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ion</a> at about 120 kJ 
      mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>. However, 
      small deviations from linearity in the bond angle (up to 20&deg;) 
      possibly have a relatively minor effect [<a href="ref.html#r100" name="r100" title="go to cited reference" id="r100">100</a>]. 
      The dependency on bond length is very important and has been 
      shown to  decay with distance exponentially [<a href="ref2.html#r101" name="r101" title="go to cited reference" id="r101">101</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="c" id="c"></a>Whether a hydrogen bond is considered 
      broken or just stretched or bent should be defined by 
      its strength, but, as the isolated bond strength may be difficult 
      to determine, this often remains a matter of an arbitrary definition based 
      on distances and angles.&nbsp;Several geometric, energetic, and combined definitions of hydrogen-bonding in water have been tested using models  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2997">2997</a><a name="r2997" id="r2997"></a>]. An arrangement with strained geometry is very unlikely to last long. It may, however, occur during the breakage, formation, or partner-switching (that is, bifurcation) of a hydrogen bond or arise transiently, due to thermal effects or other molecular interactions, in a long-lived hydrogen bond. The lifetime of a hydrogen bond 
      (if more than 10<sup>&minus;13 </sup>s) presents another measure 
      of hydrogen bond formation, but this also suffers from uncertainties 
      in the definition of its geometry. Broken hydrogen bonds do not last long enough to present a free hydroxyl (O-H) infrared spectrum (&lt;10<sup>&minus;14</sup> - 10<sup>&minus;13 </sup>s) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1687">1687</a><a name="r1687" id="r1687"></a>]. Indeed, when bonds lengthen or bend in natural water, there will be the opportunity to form weaker bonds elsewhere, and it is almost impossible to lose all interactions with the neighbors. Many hydrogen-bonding definitions have involved theoretically unsupported sharp cutoffs  separating hydrogen-bonded from non-bonded molecules. Often these involve considerable transient breakage,  which should be treated as an artifact of the definition employed [<a href="ref25.html#r2417" name="r2417" title="go to cited reference" id="r2417">2417</a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="d" id="d"></a>Some researchers consider the hydrogen bond to be broken if the bond length is greater than 3.10 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> or the bond 
      angle less than 146&deg; [<a href="ref2.html#r173" name="r173" title="go to cited reference" id="r173">173</a>]. Other workers use more generous 
      parameters; for example, in [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref9.html#r848">848</a><a name="r848" id="r848"></a>], 
      the hydrogen bond length must be less than 3.50 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> and 
      the bond angle greater than 120&deg;, whereas others suggest hydrogen-bonding based on nearest neighbors [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1432">1432</a><a name="r1432" id="r1432"></a>] or several combinations of lengths with angles (e.g., nearest neighbor O-O distances above 3.3 &Aring; at &theta; = 0&ordm; = straight and above 2.5 &Aring; at &theta; = 45&ordm; [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r613">613</a>] ). The importance of choosing a correct definition for the hydrogen bonds has been examined [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1240">1240</a><a name="r1240" id="r1240"></a>]. The simple distance criterion of 2.50 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> for the H&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;O distance was found very useful and cheapest in computational terms, whereas methods based on energy proved poor. Adding further criteria, such as the bond angles, proved of marginal use [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1240">1240</a>].  Six different hydrogen bond definitions are described in [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1555">1555</a><a name="r1555" id="r1555"></a>], where they all gave the same qualitative picture of the spectroscopy. Using simulations, it has been proposed that purely geometric and energetic definitions are inaccurate as they may overestimate the connectivity and lifetime of hydrogen bonds and cannot distinguish improper relative orientations [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1335">1335</a><a name="r1335" id="r1335"></a>]. Such overestimates may, however, be balanced by underestimates due to the cutoff parameters. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The differences between the  O-H and H&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;O bond lengths have also been suggested as an indication of hydrogen-bonding, where a water's hydrogen bond gives a difference around 0.75 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> with fluctuations (with bond angles &asymp; 155&deg; - 180&deg;). The hydrogen bond can be considered broken with O-H  H&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;O bond length differences varying with the bond angle (180&deg; 1.67 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>; 135&deg; 1.53 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>; 90&deg; 1.40 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>). More simply for hydrogen bonds of significant strength (covering  about 99% of water hydrogen bonds), and where the O-H  H&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;O bond length difference is less than 1.25 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2025">2025</a>]. The use of  network science determined that energetic criteria rather than geometric criteria was best for determining hydrogen-bond  breakage [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2994">2994</a><a name="r2994" id="r2994"></a>]. Some of the methods for defining water's hydrogen bond have been compared and reviewed [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2028">2028</a><a name="r2028" id="r2028"></a>]. Ultrafast hydrogen-bond dynamics of liquid water have been revealed by terahertz-induced transient birefringence [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref41.html#r4045">4045</a><a name="r4045" id="r4045"></a>]. An  extended jump model  has provided a quantitative description of the O-H reorientation in water based on   hydrogen-bond exchanges around hydrogen bonded rings and the  'simple' reorientation (turning)  of intact hydrogen-bonded dimers [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref41.html#r4060">4060</a><a name="r4060" id="r4060"></a>].  The contributions to water reorientation from each component of the activation energy were explained in terms of exchange and turning component activation energies.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Finally, it is crucial to recognize that any definition of the hydrogen bond in terms of energy or geometry is an approximation and cannot give accurate results or separate the overlap between the first and second-shell distributions that invariably occur in a liquid. Further, the definition determines the number of 'hydrogen bonds' found around each water molecule.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>Ab initio</em> calculations indicate that most 
      of the bonding energy remains, and more bent but shorter 
      bonds may be relatively strong; for example, one of the hydrogen 
      bonds in <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_iv.html">ice-four</a> (143&deg;). Similarly, 
      O&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;H-O interaction energies 
      below 10 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> have been taken as indicative 
      of broken hydrogen bonds, although they are almost 50% as strong 
      as 'perfect' hydrogen bonds and there is no reason to presuppose 
      that it is solely the hydrogen bond that has been affected 
      with no contributions from other interactions. Also, the  
       bonding strength must depend on the orientation and positions of 
      the other bonded and non-bonded atoms and 'lone pair' electrons 
      [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r525">525</a><a name="r525" id="r525"></a>]. The use of different definitions for hydrogen bonding gives rise to very different results for the amount and lifetime of the hydrogen bonds and the structure  of putative clustering and solute hydration.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many of the problems involved in describing hydrogen bonds by their geometry are removed if characterized by their strength or their charge transfer  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3479">3479</a><a name="r3479" id="r3479"></a>]. It was  found that the O-H stretch frequency  is inversely related to the hydrogen bond strength (&Delta;E<sub>D&rarr;A</sub>) or the hydrogen bond charge-transfer (&Delta;CT<sub>D&rarr;A</sub>). These values (&Delta;E<sub>D&rarr;A</sub>, &Delta;CT<sub>D&rarr;A</sub>) are shown  to predict water's hydrogen bond  rearrangement dynamics.    </p>

    <p>Where<strong> &alpha;</strong> and <strong>&beta;</strong> are constants. The rationale is because when the bonding in the product(s) is stronger <strong>(&minus;</strong><strong>H<sub>R</sub><sub>1</sub></strong> &gt; <strong>&minus;H<sub>P2</sub></strong>), it also contains less disorder (<strong>S<sub>P2</sub> &lt; S<sub>R1</sub></strong>), with the structure  being more firmly fixed. Therefore, the <strong>&Delta;H</strong> term goes down (more negative) as the   <strong>&minus;T &#739; &Delta;S</strong>  term goes up (less negative), and consequentially, the <strong>&Delta;G</strong> term moves little. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It has been argued that entropy-enthalpy compensation is an artifact as the two variables are very largely the same variable looked at in different ways (A.
