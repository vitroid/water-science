    I am a biochemist not well trained in the deeper aspects of thermodynamics.  However, I need to know the heat of solvation of water by water.  Does this have a special name?  Is it something that can actually be measured?  If so, where might I find the number I'm looking for?

    Awe inspiring amount of work went into this site. Thank you for making it available to all that work in water related fields.
    We are presently doing an apparatus design study prior to fabricating the equipment fo our next series of tests related to the water vortex. We have succeeded in generating an &quot;eyewall&quot; type water vortex similar to a hurricane eyewall.( different configuration from a cone shaped tornado shaped water vortex). The near perfect vertical cylinder shape vortex should make it ideal to do some investigations using magnets, ultrasound, UV, high voltage fields, Microwave, aereation etc.
    You may have a suggestion or idea we can use in designing the setup to make it as modular as possible.PDF pics are available of the setup we can forward.
    Our research is directed toward methods of reducing mineral content in brackish and seawater prior to the RO process. A side benefit may be an improved method of reducing bacteria,virus and exotics form domestic water.<br />

I tried searching other websites for refereed journals on processed water (including oxygenated water) and its health claims. However, the search had not been fruitful. I would be very grateful if you could point me to any scientific articles, websites or expert source.

    I am a father of a 7th grade student and we are doing a projet on freezing hot water and cold water and which one freezes faster hoping to duplicate the Mpemba effect. My son is adopted and an African American young man of 12 and I am of Irish descent, so I was thrilled to see how an African High School boy found that freezing warm ice cream was faster and that he convinced the scientific community he found something remarkable about the rate of freezing hot versus cold. We picked this project because for me it was just understood a bucket of warm water placed outside in the winter would freeze faster than a bucket of cold water because my parent told me and it was common knowledge among midwestern farmers. I never really questioned it. By reading this I see it is not all that simple and often does not work at various tempetures. We certainly take water for granted yet it is a mystery in many aspects, as a patent attorney I love it when things suprise us. Thanks for your wonderful website. David and Ray<br />

    Experiment:
    
    Materials:
    
    -2 glasses  -Food coloring
    -2 watches  -Water boiler
    
    Instructions:
    
    Put boiling hot water in one glass and cold water in the other. Take the food coloring and place 4 drops in the cold water then start the timer. Then you do the same thing with the hot water and keep an eye on both glasses. When water is fully mixed, stop the timer and look at the other glass, watch the glass until the food coloring is mixed in then stop the timer.
    
    Results:
    
    When i did this experiment, the hot water took arround 22 seconds to mix and the cold water took arround 11 minutes to mix.
    
    Conclution:
    
    The hot water molecules move so fast, that the molecules move the coloring arround, but the cold molecules move too slow to move the coloring around very fast.<br />

    <strong>Dear Professor Chaplin</strong>, This question is very important for my research and I dont know any other person, who I can ask. As I understand, water usualy form cluster structures   around polymer 
    molecules. But what happens   to water in case the water flows inside the 
    polymer gel?&nbsp; On the one hand water is Newtonian fluid, viscosity   is 
    independent to strain rate (flow   velocity). But on the other hand, pores 
    inside the gel are very small and water clusters can &quot;work&quot; as   microcolloids 
    or, on the contrary, be broken   by shear (and viscosity will be dependent on 
    flow velocity). Can it be possible or not? If it is known to be   possible, 
    than at what scales and conditions   of the polymer gel? 
    The second question is the same, but about   protein-water solution flowing 
    through the   gel instead of pure water. Can proteins influence water 
    permeability of the gel by mecanism of water clustering? Does   strain rate 
    influence the amount of water   bound to gel-forming molecules or to proteins 
    in solution? 
    Thank you very much for your attention and   help. 
    All the best, <br />

    As I came back from a long walk under the hot sun (Newbury) which I   have not seen in UK for all my stay (last 10 years) but only back in India, I   grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge and took a long gulp as my elder   daughter asked 'Dad, did you know water is not supposed to exist as a liquid at   this temperature?' (admittedly she is becoming a geek at 9 years). I did hear   this long time back but never had any material to study about this but armed   with the pc and broadband, had a go at it and found your site. Sir, I deeply   respect and admire your knowledge and more than that your effort in maintaining   this colassal information organised and presented in such a way that even I can   make sense of this and can chat with my daughter and mesmerize her.

    <b>Dear Professor Chaplin, </b><strong>What a wealth of knowledge!</strong> And it is so orderly presented. It is extremely rare to find such abundance of data in such an organized way. I am truly amazed and I wanted to congratulate you for the enormous amount of work you did and to thank you for allowing anyone to benefit from it.
    I got in a discussion with my neighbour who is a construction contractor. We chatted about the damages caused by frost to buildings and to water pipes and we was both know for a fact that this was due to an increase in volume of the ice as it reaches a given temperature. 
    Yet, we don't know more than this increase of volume is around 11/10 that of water, according to what is widely referred to for icebergs.
    I did an intensive search on the Internet in order to find a graph where the change in volume versus the change in temperature would be correlated in a way we, the laymen, could visualize it readily.
    I did find charts but it always seems that the data are collected from freezing point an up. I am looking for a graph where we could see a continuity in the line from say, -40C through maybe 100C.
    I tried to extrapolate from the various values I found for the density, but I am not getting anywhere. I seem to get stuck at around 3.98C in terms of maximum volume.
    Thus my frustration in trying to explain to myself at what temperature exactly is the ice reaching its largest volume. I thought that working from the density backwards I could get somewhere but I do not have the maths to do it right it seems.
    I thought the change in volume due to temperature was somewhat linear, according to this formula [0.000053&nbsp;&deg;C-1 (-20&nbsp;&deg;C)], but this doesn't help, obviously.
    I suspect that this is trivial to you and it would not take too much of your time to find it out.
    
    You kind help would be greatly appreciated.
    
    Again, congratulations and thank you for this wonderful website.

    I have been treating  my own water for quite some time now. So far the most effective method of the  several methods tried has been treating tap water firstly with a Brita filter  (others would work fine as long as they are charcoal based to alter or inactivate  the chlorine). This is then put into my water bottle, which contains various  crystals, which have been checked for their various chemical compositions  (don't want poisons leeching into my drinking water). This water almost seems  to be absorbed on its way down. When doused it is differs from the filtered tap  water before contact with the crystals. When watering plants there is a marked  difference from this water in that the crystal treated water shows more  benefit. A friend began feeding this water to her love birds, the effect of  which was her female bird laid an egg (a big suprise). Tap water that does not  have the chlorine neutralized will douse poorly even after contact with the  crystals. The negative energy from the chlorine must be not only neutralized  but the stored signal in the water must also be over written. Much like a tape  recording, if erased (filtered) and played back at a higher volume, the  recording still leaves an imprint (basis of homeopathy) until the tape is  recorded over. At which time there is no longer any evidence of the previous  recording. jens ^j^<br />

    <b>Dear Professor Chaplin</b> I have just been studying your informative and interesting water website to answer some background fact checking information needed for a future programme. I see you have this statement:
    'Water should be drunk little but often throughout the day such that we are never thirsty. It is particularly important to hydrate last thing at night to prepare for the significant loss of water during sleeping and rehydrate first thing in the morning as this is a time when the blood is most viscous and strokes particularly prevalent. We should also drink before, during and after exercise to maintain our level of hydration.'
    My particular interest is to resolve the question as to whether or not, in a survival or hazardous situation, in a desert environment the optimal water hydration strategy is to drink most of your water ration daily and only retain enough to supress the thirst reflex throughout the daylight hours or, alternatively, as you suggest, drink little but often throughout the day and accept the loss of water due to evaporation, or adopt a mixed strategy according to circumstance and expectations. I wonder, if by posing you this query, you would consider a revision of your observations appropriate?
    Sincerely

    <b>Exellent site</b>, only thing I could not find 
    (although one suggesting graph gave a hint) was the density 
    of ice I as function of temperature. This was due a quick research 
    on the intresting everyday anomaly of why household water pipes 
    tend to burst more easily on quck warming than on freezing phase. 
    Say from -25C to -5C you get a lot of burst pipes (like just 
    last week here in Finland). Assumption (one of them) is that 
    pipes do freeze when temperature goes down (bursting some pipes 
    entirely) but most of freezing happens on inner surface of pipe 
    only, leaving a conduit for water and not damaging the pipe 
    (nice explanation of why hot water pipes are more vulnerable 
    was found too). Then when temperature rises the ice expands 
    and bursts the pipe which has been operating OK (not blocked) 
    so far. I managed to find the thermal expansion graph for ice 
    and indeed it's expansion coefficient is positive and on order 
    of 30*10^-6/C which is about double of copper. So it seems like 
    an reasonable explanation. <br />

    When I was a semiconductor engineer, I became aware 
    of what was called 18 Megohm water. This is water which is pure 
    enough to be used in semiconductor fabrication. 18 Megohm water 
    is a violent solvent and will even dissolve some of the quartz 
    flasks which are used to hold it. I was told then that the purification 
    of water, due to this narural solvency, is one of the most difficult 
    chemistry problems. Many years later I became involved with 
    making colloidal silver for healing as a hobby. Making colloidal 
    silver is quite simple however requires pure water since any 
    impurities will precipitate into the solution as contaminants. 
    Good distilled water has a resistance of about 100K ohms, a 
    long way from 18 Megohms. Then in 2001 Florida began using a 
    form of ammonia and chlorine in the public drinking water, chloramine. 
    After this I was never able to buy any distilled water good 
    enough to make colloidal silver again. Apparently the water-ammonia 
    bond is so strong that it requires special processing to purify. 
    If anyone knows of a way to remove ammonia from water please 
    advise. Thanks.<br />

    structures such as water will form with ordinary surfactants, 
    is the nature of the stabilizing thermodynamic forces behind 
    helical coil polymers such as collagen and DNA and just as well 
    for shoe-leather. What sources do you recomend I look into in

    such controversies as homeopathy. I came across it while writing 
    about the film &quot;What the Bleep&quot;, which homes in on the claims 
    of Dr Emoto that water can be influenced by thoughts (!), and 
    offers as evidence some pictures of ice crystals. This site 
    shows that the weirdness of water is much more profound than 
    this. Ironically, many of the anomalies of water seem to be 
    due to hydrogen bonds, which themselves are affected by quantum 
    vacuum effects - precisely the kind of weird phenomena the makers 
    of What the Bleep are so keen to talk about. What a shame they

    <b>Excellent site and certainly no curate's egg </b>(more like 
    the 'fertile' variety). It is refreshing to see this kind of 
    intense dedication to such an important subject. Assuming that 
    your guest book also serves the role as discussion forum, here 
    is a Query (candle) for ongoing consideration: There seems to 
    be anecdotal or loose evidence connecting the physical properties 
    of: 1) expansion on freezing 2) diamagnetism 3) electrical conductivity 
    &amp; perhaps even eventual superconductivity (local or bulk), especially 
    at elevated pressure. Helium, bismuth, and water are partial 
    examples for what could possibly be an underlying tendency towards 
    these traits, derived from nanostructure, one might surmise. 
    ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
    In trying to find a reference for the electrical conductivity 
    of 4 degree water, the following carefully researched article 
    and charts appears to negate the possibility of anything unusual 
    in water: http://www.thorntoninc.com/pdf_files/tech_pubs/ECS_04.pdf .....as the conductivity of water rises steadily, though not 
    linearly from 0 to 100&nbsp;&deg;C, even though the differential change 
    is greatest at lower temperatures. However, no real effort seems 
    to have been made to look for small variations around 4 degrees, 
    nor to look at the detailed effects of applied pressure on electrical 
    conductivity. I wonder if you know of any contrary or more detailed 
    evidence than this study provides - especially where the readings 
    were taken at very close intervals - perhaps in fractional degrees 
    around the important 4 degree mark? Regards, Jones Beene<br />

    Here is the 2000 year old question: I have seen farmers being 
    devasted with lack of rainfall here in Thailand. What is so 
    unusual about it is that watering plants with ordinary tap water 
    or river water whether it be on potted plants or in the field, 
    the effects on plant growth is not the same. Rain water always 
    makes plant grow faster, germinate faster, etc. than tap water 
    or water from river. So what makes rain water so great? I know 
    there are trace amounts of Methyl Sulfonyl Methane in water, 
    but I think that is not the major reason. I think the water 
    structure are smaller.<br />
    Some years ago, I remember reading some German scientists got 
    some water from a deep well caves. They measured the water density. 
    What is so surprising is the water's density was about 0.80. 
    In other words, the density of cave water was 20% of ordinary 
    water! How could that be? Does that have to do with hydrophobic 
    minerals or is it some form of dissolved silicates from the 
    caves that causes the water density to be below normal? Since 
    it was several years ago, I do not have the papers with me. 
    Your answers will be greatly appreciated!<br />

    in terms of the high-temperature breakdown of water molecule 
    clusters. This prompts some questions in relation to declustered 
    water and its supposed - but unsubstantiated - health benefits. 
    Am I right in thinking that declustered drinking water - of 
    which there are many expensive brands on the market - may more 
    easily be obtained simply by warming ordinary water just before 
    drinking? If so, what (roughly) is the minimum water temperature 
    necessary to break down the water molecule clusters? Presumably 
    hot drinks like tea and coffee will comprise declustered water 
    and thus offer the same health effects. Or does such heat-declustered 
    water too rapidly revert to its clustered form once imbibed 
    and cooled down to body temperature? <br />

    As we cannot unambiguously determine the changes in the (cluster-scale) 
    structuring of the water, we do not know how long such effects

    is far less than a second, whereas some practical phenomena

    <strong>Excellent</strong>, comprehensive overview on the 
    many aspects of water. Well organized and well referenced. It 
    has been my experience that Brits typically write some of the 
    best science reference material. (I hope your censorship policy 
    does not include gratuitous advertisements for this website)

    I just came across your wonderful website. My interest is in 
    the possibilities for clustered water. Can clustered water be 
    achieved by any way other than a chemical or mechanical process? 
    Thanks for your response.<br />

    I read an extract of Professor Madelaine Ennis's ( of Queens 
    University, Belfast)recent work which gives some credibility 
    to that of Benveniste's paper in (Nature, 1988) concerning extreme 
    dilution effects in water. I am puzzled that no mention is made 
    in the Ennis extract regarding whether the control water was 
    or was not vigorously shaken, since the mechanical action might 
    impart sufficient energy to this delicate system, to change 
    the microstructure of the water. Was shaken water used as a 
    control?? Andrew Ciesielski.<br />

    This site on water is fantastic! I ran into it as I was beginning 
    to write a review chapter on water and solids mobility in foods 
    and have been a faithful site visitor ever since! Thanks Martin 
    for all your hard work to make your site an incredible resource! 
    Please keep up that GREAT work!<br />
