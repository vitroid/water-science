    <h2><a name="el" id="el"></a>Electric effects on water </h2>
    <p align="left">Water, being dipolar, can be partially aligned by an electric field, and this may be easily shown by the movement of a stream of water 
      by an electrostatic source [<a  href="ref2.html#r163" name="r163" title="go to cited reference" id="r163">163</a>]. 
      Very high field strengths (&gt;2.5&nbsp;  &#739; 10<sup>9</sup> V   &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>) 
      cause water dissociation in liquid water and hexagonal ice  with slightly higher field strengths (&gt;3.6  &#739; 10<sup>9</sup> V   &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>), causing continued proton flow in ice [<a  href="ref22.html#r2131" name="r2131" title="go to cited reference" id="r2131">2131</a>]. Strong electric fields have complex effects on ice formation and dissociation.  In molecular dynamics simulations, electric fields between 0.45  V   &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup> and 3   &#739; 10<sup>9</sup> V   &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup> accelerate the freezing of water into cubic ice  by affecting the arrangement of neighbors in the second coordination shell of a water molecule [<a  href="ref34.html#r3340" name="r3340" title="go to cited reference" id="r3340">3340</a>]. However, higher field strengths (5  &#739; 10<sup>9</sup> V   &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>) 
      reorient water in ice such that freezing is inhibited 
      [<a  href="ref3.html#r251" name="r251" title="go to cited reference" id="r251">251</a>], with lower fields (10<sup>5</sup> V  &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>) encouraging ice formation in supercooled water [<a  href="ref14.html#r1327" name="r1327" title="go to cited reference" id="r1327">1327</a>] by weakening the hydrogen-bonding. Even partial alignment 
      of the water molecules with the electric field will cause pre-existing 
      hydrogen bonding to bend or break. The balance between hydrogen 
      bonding and <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> dispersion attractions is thus biased towards van 
      der Waals attractions giving rise to less cyclic hydrogen-bonded 
      clustering. An electric field also changes the molecular O-H bond lengths (25  &#739; 10<sup>9</sup> V   &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup> causing &asymp; &plusmn;6% change in a lone water molecule), H-O-H bond angle (25  &#739; 10<sup>9</sup> V   &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup> causing &asymp; +1%/-0.2% change in a lone water molecule), vibrational frequencies and dissociation energy, depending on the relative orientation of the molecule to the field  [<a  href="ref18.html#r1727" name="r1727" title="go to cited reference" id="r1727">1727</a>]. This will affect the hydrogen-bonded network in an anisotropic manner.</p>

    <p>High interfacial fields (E &gt; 10<sup>9</sup> V   &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>, &gt; thermal energy) 
    at electrode (or charged) surfaces can cause a phase transition 
    with an ordered layering of water at high densities similar 
    to <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_x.html">ice X</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r420">420</a><a name="r420" id="r420"></a>]. Depending on the   field's value, the restriction pressures may cause melting or freezing as corresponding to the <a href="water_phase_diagram.html">normal phase behavior</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r873">873</a><a name="r873" id="r873"></a>]. High 
    fields (E &asymp;  V   &#739; nm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) might also be 
    found (perhaps surprisingly) at the surface of hydrophilic 
    molecules, where they are caused by the partial charges on the atoms 
    and the small distances between the surface and first hydration 
    layer. High fields affect <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen bonding</a> in an anisotropic manner, hydrogen bonds being strengthened 
    along the field but weakened orthogonal to the field [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r582">582</a><a name="r582" id="r582"></a>]. Such fields have shown this anisotropic effect (under molecular modeling) on the dynamic viscosity of water (see right, c <a name="r2806" id="r2806"></a>].). At low fields, however, both translational and rotational 
    motions may be reduced. Electric fields are  expected to increase the differences in the properties between the <a href="ortho_para_water.html">ortho and para forms of water</a> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1186">1186</a><a name="r1186" id="r1186"></a>]. Electric fields also lower the dielectric 
    constant of the water [<a name="r616" id="r616"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r616">616</a>] 
    due to the resultant partial or complete destruction of the 
    hydrogen-bonded network.

      towards the electrode, whereas +0.52 V reverses this, with both 
      causing some hydrogen bond breakage and localized density 
      increase.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#d"> d</a><a name="bd" id="bd"></a></sup> Ions 
      are attracted or repelled dependent on their charge. Similar 
      orientations may take place at the surface of minerals containing 
      alternating positive and negative charges such that a solid 
      (static and non-exchangeable) water layer has been reported 
      at the surface of highly polar metal oxides, (for example, TiO<sub>2</sub>). Also, an ambient temperature single layer ice 
      (with all the donor hydrogen bonds oriented towards each other 
      or the silica surface oxygen atoms) is found, using modeling, 
      on the surface of hydrophilic fully hydroxylated silica ([<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r701">701</a><a name="r701" id="r701"></a>], 
      called ice tessellation), which may explain the many layers 
      of structured water found on the surfaces of complex silicates. 
      Thus, a high-voltage electric field (333 kV &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>) 
      has been shown to raise the <a href="water_activity.html">water 
      activity</a> in bread dough,  ensuring  more efficient 
      hydration of the gluten [<a  href="ref4.html#r331" name="r331" title="go to cited reference" id="r331">331</a>]. 
      Somewhat 
      unexpectedly, such electric fields (&asymp; 1 MV m<sup>&minus;1</sup>) 
      increase water's surface tension by about 2% [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r680">680</a><a name="r680" id="r680"></a>].<sup><a name="be" id="be"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#e"> e</a></sup></p>

    <p align="left">The effect of alternating (AC, 100 GHz to 1000 GHz) electric field on static and dynamic properties of water has been investigated [<a  href="ref39.html#r3826" name="r3826" title="go to cited reference" id="r3826">3826</a>]. It has been reported that passing low-frequency alternating electric current (4 - 20 Hz) through distilled, deionized water using platinum electrodes causes the water to cool [<a  href="ref35.html#r3410" name="r3410" title="go to cited reference" id="r3410">3410</a>]; a result that has to be substantiated. The rationale for this behavior is ascribed to a decrease in water entropy due to an increase in low-density water. </p>

      [<a  href="ref17.html#r1651" name="r1651" title="go to cited reference" id="r1651">1651</a>]. Water is diamagnetic and may be levitated in very high magnetic

      [<a  href="ref2.html#r170" name="r170" title="go to cited reference" id="r170">170</a>]. Lower but still powerful magnetic

      the number of monomer water molecules [<a  href="ref2.html#r192" name="r192" title="go to cited reference" id="r192">192</a>] 
      but, rather surprisingly, they increase the <a title="go to 'Water molecular structure' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html#e">tetrahedrality</a> at the same time. Other studies show that an increase in cluster size in liquid water is caused by a magnetic field [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1597">1597</a>]. In contrast, the friction coefficient of water in thin films has been shown to reduce in a magnetic field (0.16-0.53 <a href="constants.html#T">T</a>), indicating a possible reduction in hydrogen bond strength  
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2012">2012</a><a name="r2012" id="r2012"></a>]. </p>

Magnetic fields of ~0.5 <a href="constants.html#T">T</a>, or more, cause  dips in the surface with  depths of 10 -10<sup>4</sup> &micro;m. Such processing is reported to help descale metal surfaces, improve cement hydration, change the &zeta; potential of colloids, accelerate the growth of plants irrigated with such water, enhance calcium efflux   through biomembranes and influence the structure of model liposomes  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r110">110</a>]. The effect has a 'memory' effect of minutes to hours after the treatment; orders of magnitude longer than expected from water's normal relaxation processes (ps - ns). This is thought due to the formation of reactive oxygen species during treatment.</p>

However, this only causes a net reduction in hydrogen-bonding at high salt concentrations (for example, 5 M NaCl), whereas at lower concentrations (1 M NaCl), the increase in water hydrogen-bonding in the presence of such high magnetic fields more than compensates for this effect  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1431">1431</a>].

      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r485">485</a><a name="r485" id="r485"></a>]. The increased refractive index with the magnetic field has been attributed 
      to increased hydrogen bond strength [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r647">647</a><a name="r647" id="r647"></a>]. 
      Weak magnetic fields (15 m<a href="constants.html#T">T</a>) [<a  href="ref13.html#r1278" name="r1278" title="go to cited reference" id="r1278">1278</a>] and stronger perpendicular magnetic fields (75 m<a href="constants.html#T">T</a>) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2939">2939</a><a name="r2939" id="r2939"></a>] have also been shown to increase the evaporation rate. These effects are consistent with the magnetic fields weakening 
      the van der Waals bonding between the water molecules<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#a"> a</a><a name="ba" id="ba"></a></sup> and the water molecules being more tightly bound, due to the 
      magnetic field reducing the thermal motion of the inherent 
      charges by generating dampening forces [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r703">703</a><a name="r703" id="r703"></a>]. 
      Due to the<a href="clusters_overview.html"> fine balance</a> between 
      the conflicting hydrogen-bonding and non-bonded interactions 
      in water clusters, any such weakening of the van der Waals 
      attraction  further strengthens  the hydrogen 
      bonding and greater cyclic hydrogen-bonded clustering. This 
      effect of the magnetic field on the hydrogen-bonding has been 
      further supported by (a) the increased ease of supercooling (5 m<a href="constants.html#T">T</a> lowering by about 1&nbsp;&deg;C, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref20.html#r1908">1908</a><a name="r1908" id="r1908"></a>]), (b) the rise in the melting point of H<sub>2</sub>O 
      (5.6 m<a href="constants.html#kelvin">K</a> at 6 <a href="constants.html#T">T</a>) and D<sub>2</sub>O (21.8 m<a href="constants.html#kelvin">K</a> at 6 <a href="constants.html#T">T</a>) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r703">703</a>] 
      and (c) the 3&nbsp;&deg;C lowering of the sol-gel transition (at 0.3 <a href="constants.html#T">T</a>) in <a title="go for more information"  href="cellulose.html#me">methylcellulose</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1203">1203</a><a name="r1203" id="r1203"></a>]. These indicate a weakening 
      of the van der Waals bonding of the water molecules within a magnetic field. More significant effects on the contact 
      angle and Raman bands have been shown to occur using strong 
      magnetic fields (6 <a href="constants.html#T">T</a>) when the water contains dissolved oxygen 
      (but not without the paramagnetic oxygen), indicating effects due to greater 
      clathrate-type water formation [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r970">970</a><a name="r970" id="r970"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The magnetic susceptibility of water increases from negative towards positive with magnetic frequency. It is reported to be positive (i.e., it is slightly paramagnetic) in  the range of 0.4-1 MHz [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1761">1761</a><a name="r1761" id="r1761"></a>] for ambient water. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Static magnetic effects have 
      been shown to cause strengthened hydrogen bonding [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1693">1693</a><a name="r1693" id="r1693"></a>] and an increase in the ordered structure of 
      water formed around hydrophobic molecules and colloids [<a  href="ref2.html#r106" name="r106" title="go to cited reference" id="r106">106</a>], 
      as shown by the increase in fluorescence of dissolved probes 
      [<a  href="ref2.html#r108" name="r108" title="go to cited reference" id="r108">108</a>]. Also, magnetic fields affect the infrared spectrum of water (showing its effect on water clustering), and these effects remain for a considerable time after the magnetic field is removed [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1697">1697</a><a name="r1697" id="r1697"></a>]. Treatment of water with magnetic fields may exert beneficial or detrimental effects on feeding to animals, depending on the strength of the field  
      [<a  href="ref2.html#r4369" name="r4369" title="go to cited reference" id="r4369">4369</a>]. Surprisingly, even tiny magnetic fields may affect the solubility of gases in seawater (solubility increasing with the magnetic field (20-50 &micro;T)  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1492">1492</a><a name="r1492" id="r1492"></a>], probably by their effect on the clathrate stability. This reinforces 
      the view that it is the movement through a magnetic field 
      and its associated electromagnetic effect that is important 
      for disrupting the hydrogen bonding. Such fields can also 
      increase the evaporation rate of water, the dissolution 
      rate of oxygen (due to its paramagnetic nature), and how the ultraviolet absorbance and the surface tension of the water may be affected [<a  href="ref43.html#r4209" name="r4209" title="go to cited reference" id="r4209">4209</a>]. However, despite claims by certain <a href="otherwater.html#decluster">expensive 
      water preparations</a>, they cannot increase the equilibrium amount of oxygen dissolved 
      in water above its established, and rather low, equilibrium 
      concentration [<a  href="ref2.html#r176" name="r176" title="go to cited reference" id="r176">176</a>]. 
      Magnetic fields can also increase proton spin relaxation [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r623">623</a><a name="r623" id="r623"></a>], 
      which may speed up some reactions dependent on proton transfer. Treatment of water with magnetic fields of about one Tesla 
      increases the strength of mortar due to its greater hydration 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r426">426</a><a name="r426" id="r426"></a>]. Treatment  with constant transverse magnetic or electric fields is reported to  give  a disinfection effect

    <p>From the above, it appears that electric and magnetic fields have opposite 
      effects on water clustering. Unstructured water with fewer hydrogen bonds is a more reactive 
      environment [<a  href="ref3.html#r286" name="r286" title="go to cited reference" id="r286">286</a>], 
      as exemplified by the enhanced reactivity of <a href="water_phase_diagram.html" title="go to a description of water's phases">supercritical 
      water</a>.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#b"> b</a><a name="bb" id="bb"></a></sup> An 
      open, more hydrogen-bonded network structure slows reactions 
      due to its increased viscosity, reduced diffusivities, and 
      the less active participation of water molecules. Any factors 
      that reduce hydrogen bonding and hydrogen bond strength, such 
      as electric fields, should encourage reactivity. Water clusters 
      (even with random arrangements) have equal <a href="spher.html#Fig3">hydrogen 
      bonding in all directions</a>. As such, electric or electromagnetic 
      fields that attempt to reorient the water molecules should 
      necessitate the breakage of some hydrogen bonds; for example, electric fields have been reported to halve the mean water 
      cluster size as measured by <sup>17</sup>O-NMR [<a  href="ref2.html#r111" name="r111" title="go to cited reference" id="r111">111</a>] 
      (see also <a href="otherwater.html#decluster">'declustered' water</a>) and increase reaction rates [<a  href="ref14.html#r1336" name="r1336" title="go to cited reference" id="r1336">1336</a>], hydration and solubility. 
      Electromagnetic radiation (for example, microwave) has been 
      shown to exert its effect primarily through the electrical 
      rather than magnetic effect [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r455">455</a><a name="r455" id="r455"></a>]. 
      The increased hydration ability of water in electromagnetic 
      fields has been shown by the dissociation of an enzyme 
      dimer (electric eel acetylcholinesterase), leading to gel 
      formation due to the microwave radiation from a mobile phone 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r714">714</a><a name="r714" id="r714"></a>]. The resultant 
      aqueous restructuring caused by such processes may be kinetically 
      stable. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The solubility properties 
      of the water will change in the presence of such fields and 
      may result in the concentration of dissolved gases and hydrophobic 
      molecules at surfaces followed by reaction (for example, due to reactive singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) 
      or free radical formation such as OH&middot;) or phase changes (for example, the formation of flattish surface nanocavities, termed <a  title="go for more information"  href="nanobubble.html">nanobubbles</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r506">506</a><a name="r506" id="r506"></a>]). 
      It is also possible that these processes may result in the production of low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide isimilarly  to mechanical vibrations [<a name="r1066" id="r1066"></a><a href="ref11.html#r1066">1066</a>, see <a href="memory_of_water.html#vibr">equations</a>]. Such changes can result in effects lasting for a considerable 
      time, giving rise to claims for 'memory' effects. One of the 
      curious facts concerning reports of the effects of magnets 
      and electromagnetic radiation on the properties of water 
      is the long lifetime these effects seem to have (for example, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r757">757</a><a name="r757" id="r757"></a>]). However, this 
      should not be so surprising  as it can take several 
      days for the effects, of the addition of salts to water, to 
      finally stop oscillating [<a  href="ref.html#r4" name="r4" title="go to cited reference" id="r4">4</a>] and several months where such solutions are still changing [<a  href="ref12.html#r1148" name="r1148" title="go to cited reference" id="r1148">1148</a>]. 
      Also, there is evidence that water structuring in undisturbed deaerated 
      pure water increases over a day or two [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r509">509</a><a name="r509" id="r509"></a>], changes in dilute ethanol solution occur over days [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1102">1102</a><a name="r1102" id="r1102"></a>], and changes in homeopathic preparations  occur over hundreds of days [<a href="ref11.html#r1039">1039</a><a name="r1039" id="r1039"></a>].<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#g"> a</a><a name="bg" id="bg"></a></sup> Also, clathrates may persist metastably in water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r485">485</a>], 
      water restructuring after infrared radiation may persist for 
      more than a day [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r730">730</a><a name="r730" id="r730"></a>], 
      and water photoluminescence (possibly due to impurities at 
      gas/liquid interfaces [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r800">800b</a><a name="r800" id="r800"></a>]) 
      may change over days [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r801">801</a><a name="r801" id="r801"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In addition to the breakage of hydrogen bonds, electromagnetic 
      fields may perturb in the gas/liquid interface and produce 
      reactive oxygen species [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r110">110</a>]. 
      Changes in hydrogen bonding may affect carbon dioxide hydration 
      resulting in pH changes. Thus the role of dissolved gas in 
      water chemistry is likely to be more critical than commonly 
      realized [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r459">459</a><a name="r459" id="r459"></a>]; 
      particularly as the formation of <a  title="go for more information"  href="nanobubble.html">nanobubbles</a> (that is, nanocavities) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r506">506</a><a  href="ref12.html#r1129" name="r1129" title="go to cited reference" id="r1129">, 1129</a>, <a  href="ref12.html#r1172" name="r1172" title="go to cited reference" id="r1172">1172</a>]                    containing just a few hundred or less molecules of gas, the 
      stability of larger bubbles (&asymp; 300 nm diameter) detected by 
      light scattering [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r800">800a</a>] and nanobubble 
      coating of hydrophobic surfaces [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r803">803</a><a name="r803" id="r803"></a>] 
      have all been  described. Reinforcement of this view 
      comes from the effect of magnetized water on ceramic manufacture 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r601">601</a><a name="r601" id="r601"></a>] and out-gassing 
      experiments that  result in the loss of magnetic 
      and electromagnetic effects [<a  href="ref2.html#r110" name="r110" title="go to cited reference" id="r110">110</a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r800">800a</a>] or photoluminescent effects 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r800">800b</a>].&nbsp;Gas accumulating 
      at hydrophobic surfaces [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r459">459</a>b] 
      promotes the <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">hydrophobic effect</a> and low-density water formation. The accumulated gas molecules 
      at such hydrophobic surfaces become supersaturating when 
      electromagnetic effects disrupt this surface low-density water. 
      An interesting (and possibly related) 'memory of water' phenomenon 
      is the effect of water, previously exposed to weak electromagnetic 
      signals, on the distinctive patterns and handedness of colonies 
      of certain bacteria [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r971">971</a><a name="r971" id="r971"></a>]. 
      Here, the water retains the effect for at least 20 minutes 
      after exposure to the field. It has been proposed that extremely weak (40 nT) alternating magnetic fields  combined with a weak (40 &mu;T) static magnetic fields affect living systems by shifting molecules between coherent (clusters involving stronger hydrogen bonds, e.g., <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>) and incoherent (clusters involving weaker hydrogen bonds, e.g., <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>) domains [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2231">2231</a><a name="r2231" id="r2231"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="elf" id="elf"></a> Extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) have significant and lasting effects on liquid water. Using a weak field,  adjusted to give a magnetic field of 45 &micro;T, on  glutamic acid solutions causes changes in the pH  shifting towards the de-protonated species [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1896">1896</a><a name="r1896" id="r1896"></a>]. Using just water, FTIR-ATR spectroscopy (see below left) showed that the lower energy part of the stretching absorption band (&asymp; 3250 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>), which is related to the coherent fully-hydrogen-bonded population, decreases [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1896">1896</a>]. Stronger ELF-EMF fields (&asymp; 0.15 T) were applied to water, and its relative permittivity (dielectric constant) was measured and compared with that of untreated water (see below right). It was found that the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of the ELF-EMF field-treated water was 3.7% higher than the control over the frequency range of 1-10 GHz, which may indicate a higher molecular polarization  in the treated water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1897">1897</a><a name="r1897" id="r1897"></a>].</p>

    <p><a name="health" id="health"></a> If electromagnetic effects do indeed influence 
      the degree of structuring in water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref14.html#r1323">1323</a><a name="r1323" id="r1323"></a>], then it is clear that 
      they may have an impact on health. The biological effects 
      of microwaves, for example, have generally been analyzed in 
      terms of their very small heating effects. However, it should 
      be recognized that there might be significant non-thermal 
      effects (for example, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r714">714</a>]) 
      due to the imposed re-orientation of water at the surfaces 
      of biomolecular structures such as membranes [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref4.html#r356">356</a>]. 
      Similar effects on membranes have been proposed to occur due 
      to magnetic [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r657">657</a><a name="r657" id="r657"></a>] and electric fields  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1086">1086</a><a name="r1086" id="r1086"></a>]. 
      Additionally, as low-frequency, low-level alternating electric 
      fields have been found to affect the electrical conductivity 
      of pure water [<a  href="ref4.html#r358" name="r358" title="go to cited reference" id="r358">358</a>], 
      the effects of living near power cables and microwave towers 
      should, perhaps, not be thought harmless just because no theory 
      for harm has been formally recognized. Even variations in 
      the geomagnetic field may have some long-term exposure effects.&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>
    <h2><a name="digi" id="digi"></a>Other related effects</h2>
    <p>There has been some debate over 'digital 
      biology'; a proposal from Jacques Benveniste (leader of the 
      team that produced the <a href="memory_of_water.html#benven">controversial 
      homeopathy paper</a>) that 'specific molecular signals in the audio 
      range' (hypothetically the 'beat' frequencies of water's infrared 
      vibrations) may be heard, collected, transmitted (for example, by phone) and amplified to similarly affect other water molecules 
      at a receiver [<a  href="ref2.html#r134" name="r134" title="go to cited reference" id="r134">134</a>, <a  href="ref13.html#r1211" name="r1211" title="go to cited reference" id="r1211">1211</a>]. This 
      far-fetched   idea is generally thought highly implausible. However, the data 
      has reportedly been independently confirmed, but this has 
      not yet been published (which may be somewhat problematic in the present 
      skeptical climate). Note that experimental confirmation of the phenomenon 
      may not necessarily confirm the proposed mechanism. Rather interestingly, electromagnetic emission has been detected during the freezing 
      of supercooled water [<a  href="ref3.html#r297" name="r297" title="go to cited reference" id="r297">297</a>] 
      due to negative charging of the solid surface at the interface caused 
      by surface dissociation of water molecules followed by preferential 
      loss of hydrogen ions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r462">462</a><a name="r462" id="r462"></a>]; 
      a consequence, perhaps, of the Costa Ribeiro effect [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r551">551</a><a name="r551" id="r551"></a>]. 
      Therefore, it is not unreasonable  that similar effects may occur 
      during changes in the structuring of liquid water. Also, it has 
      been reported that microwave frequencies can also give rise to signals 
      audible to radar operators [<a  href="ref4.html#r356" name="r356" title="go to cited reference" id="r356">356</a>].&nbsp; Possible confirmation of the important effects of electromagnetic fields may be found in a paper from Nobel prize-winning Luc Montagnier, who declared that quite dilute solutions (of DNA) show entirely different properties from the less diluted solutions, that seem to depend on interactions with the ambient electromagnetic field [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1602">1602</a>]. Importantly, this research,  also appears to show that such effects can be transmitted through space from one container to another.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#h"> h</a><a name="bh" id="bh"></a></sup></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Belief in whether or not magnetic or electromagnetic fields can 
      have any more permanent effect on water, and solutions, depends 
      on the presence of a working hypothesis for their mode of action 
      (see also <a href="homeopathy.html">homeopathy</a>). Such hypotheses 
      are emerging. On a cautionary note, however, many studies do not treat results with proper statistical rigor or do not use 
      relevant 'untreated' material for comparison. 
      Permanent changes to the structure of water are reported following 
      exposure to resonant RLC (resistance inductance capacitance) 
      circuits [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r927">927</a><a name="r927" id="r927"></a>]. 
      The effects, however, are minor and poorly reproducible and,

    <p><a name="a" id="a"></a><sup>a</sup> This effect has been shown 
      in weakly bound van der Waals complexes  due to the coupling between 
      magnetic-field-induced energy levels (Zeeman levels) of the molecular 
      orbitals [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r659">659</a><a name="r659" id="r659"></a>]. [<a title="click for an explanation" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#ba"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

    <p><sup>b<a name="b" id="b"></a></sup> Note that this may not extend to conditions 
      of much-reduced hydrogen bonding. At close to critical and supercritical 
      conditions, water molecules may become less reactive than expected 
      with temperature increase due to the loss of hydrogen-bonding causing 
      consequential loss of the 'cage' effect, which encourages reactions 
      within the 'cage', and reduced polarization activation. [<a title="click for an explanation" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#bb"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><sup>c<a name="c" id="c"></a></sup> Note that the electric field strength 
      across the surface monolayer of water molecules may be of the order 
      of 10<sup>10</sup> V m<sup>&minus;1</sup> for just a few volts applied 
      potential. [<a title="click for an explanation" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#bc"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

    <p><sup>d<a name="d" id="d"></a></sup> The binding of water molecules to 
      uncharged metal surfaces depends on the nature of the metal. 
      On a platinum Pt(111) surface, half the water molecules form 
      Pt&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;OH<sub>2</sub> links with 
      the other half forming Pt&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;H-OH 
      bonds due to the balance between Pt&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;H 
      hydrogen bond formation and H-O bond weakening. Other metal 
      surfaces may prefer one or the other water orientation or 
      cause partial dissociation of the protons dependent on their 
      proton affinity [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r523">523</a><a name="r523" id="r523"></a>].

    <p><sup>e<a name="e" id="e"></a></sup> There is some dispute over the effects of electric and magnetic fields on surface tension. Electric and magnetic fields 
      have been reported to lower the surface tensions of <a href="water_descaling.html">natural 
      water</a> by up to 8% [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r735">735</a><a name="r735" id="r735"></a>]. 
      However, it has been noted elsewhere that surface tension measurements 
      are too sensitive to impurities to provide reliable data [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r979">979</a><a name="r979" id="r979"></a>]. High magnetic fields (10 T) have been reported as increasing the surface tension of water by almost 2% (3.3% for D<sub>2</sub>O), with this being possibly due to the stabilization of the hydrogen bonds or the dampening of surface waves  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1471">1471</a><a name="r1471" id="r1471"></a>]. 
      Other studies indicate either a lowering of surface tension within a magnetic field [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1597">1597</a>] or a raising of the surface tension with the magnetic field    [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2054">2054</a><a name="r2054" id="r2054"></a>], so no definitive conclusions may be drawn  at present, although the balance of probability is that the surface tension increases with the magnetic field. The effect of microwave irradiation on the surface tension of water also shows unique properties with the water surface tension lowered and remaining well below its original value for an extended period (minutes after the return of the temperature) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2208">2208</a><a name="r2208" id="r2208"></a>][<a title="click for an explanation" href="magnetic_electric_effects.html#be"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

    <p><sup>f<a name="f" id="f"></a></sup> Using very high voltages with high power (&asymp; 100 kV, &gt;1000 A), an electric discharge through the water may result in giving a plasma channel (&gt;10,000 K) with a broad emission spectrum from vacuum ultraviolet to infrared [<a href="ref11.html#r1076">1076</a><a name="r1076" id="r1076"></a>]. Such a system produces significant quantities of  O(aq) hydrated atoms [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3263">3263</a><a name="r3263" id="r3263"></a>], OH&middot; radicals, singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).
