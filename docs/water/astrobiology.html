    <p>The age of the Universe is  about 13.8 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a> (from the 'Big Bang'), with our galaxy (the Milky Way) 13.6 Ga, the Sun 4.6 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>, and  our solar system 4.57 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>. Water molecules were first formed after the first star formed the first supernova, probably still over 13 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>. The Earth is about 4.54 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>, but at 4.5 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>, it was hit by a Mars-sized hypothetical planet (Theia) that blasted an enormous amount of debris that formed the Moon. Any life that started before this massive collision would have died out with new life originating and evolving later. Many stars had formed before our Sun. Life has probably arisen (and perhaps been lost) many times before us, throughout the Universe as there are many planets around other stars. </p>

    <p>In space, there is not a perfect vacuum. We find water  throughout the Universe, primarily as free molecules and <a href="amorphous_ice.html" title="go for more information" >amorphous ice</a>. Its spectroscopy may be viewed by orbiting telescopes, with our atmosphere blocking most spectroscopy using land-based telescopes. The astrochemistry of water has been reviewed [<a  href="ref27.html#r2615" name="r2615" title="go to cited reference" id="r2615">2615</a>]. At temperatures below 180 K, water is a stable solid. At pressures below about a 10<sup>&minus;9</sup> <a href="constants.html#Pa">Pa</a> (such as on the surface of the Moon), solid ice is the stable phase as it will not sublime below 124  K. Gaseous and sublimed water will tend to attach itself to mineral surfaces rather than escaping  as a gas, which will stabilize it somewhat from sublimation.    Of crucial importance for a habitable planet is the presence of liquid water, necessitating an atmosphere and the required temperature range. For life to start, there must also be organic matter, either made locally or delivered from space. </p>

    <h2><a name="solar" id="solar"></a>Water in the solar system</h2>
    <p>Water was essential in the formation of the Solar System. The inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, are mainly rocky as, on their formation, water could not condense. This was due to the hot temperatures within about twice the distance of the Earth to the Sun. The Earth containis vastly more water than the traces  found on Mercury, Venus, Mars, or the Moon. The outer planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, have large diameters, low densities, and numerous satellites and ring systems. They were formed by accretion  from solid particles and condensed. water  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3120">3120</a><a name="r3120" id="r3120"></a>].  Water is found on both Enceladus (the sixth-largest moon of Saturn) and Europa (the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter). Water is a major constituent of the comets (&asymp; 80%) and the outer Solar System where we find water vapor  in the interiors and stratospheres of these giant planets.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In our solar system, the evolution of giant planets supported the existence of a habitable Earth by scattering water-rich planetesimals into the inner Solar System, allowing accretion by the Earth, and by orbiting  away from the Earth  without great eccentricity. Thus the Earth remained in a stable orbit with a stable climate [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2522">2522</a><a name="r2522" id="r2522"></a>]. </p>

    <h2><a name="water" id="water"></a>The origin of Earth's water</h2>
    <p>Hydrogen was the first element to be produced (&asymp; 10<sup>5</sup> yr) after the 'Big Bang'. Much later (&asymp; 10<sup>8</sup> yr),  carbon and oxygen were made by fusion reactions inside stars. Hydrogen, helium, and oxygen remain the three most common elements in the Universe. It is no surprise that hydrogen and water molecules are the two most abundant molecules in the Universe, with water occurring in interstellar space, on planets and asteroids, and within the atmospheres of stars like our Sun. Synthesis of H<sub>2</sub>O is initiated by the ionization of H<sub>2</sub> by cosmic-ray protons. This is followed by reaction with oxygen atoms. Water is the commonest molecule on the surface of planet Earth.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Earth contains about 1% w/w water, but only about 2% of this (&asymp; 10<sup>18</sup> m<sup>3</sup>) makes up our surface oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, clouds, and part of our air, with the rest hidden in Earth's mantle and core. This water in the hydrosphere and atmosphere has allowed life to develop, but there has been much and continuing debate over how it arrived on our planet [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2518">2518</a><a name="r2518" id="r2518"></a>]. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The likely possibilities are</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>a) It was there when planet Earth formed, &asymp; 4.54 &#739; 10<sup>9</sup> years ago  (4.54 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>), mostly accumulated from the cloud of dust surrounding the young Sun [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3740">3740</a><a name="r3740" id="r3740"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref41.html#r4061">4061</a><a name="r4061" id="r4061"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>b) It arrived soon afterward from an accumulation of water-containing rocky asteroids, &asymp; 4.5 &#739; 10<sup>9</sup> years ago (4.5 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>c) It arrived somewhat later from icy comets, &asymp; 4 &#739; 10<sup>9</sup> years ago (4 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Indeed, most of the water was present by &asymp; 3.8 &#739; 10<sup>9</sup> years ago  (3.8 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>), when there are signs of planetary life. The source of this water has been attributed on the basis of the known isotopic ratio (D/H) of water found on the Earth and Moon [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2649">2649</a><a name="r2649" id="r2649"></a>], and the analyzed comets and asteroids [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2519">2519</a><a name="r2519" id="r2519"></a>]. If the proportions have not been altered by isotopic fractionation <sup><a href="astrobiology.html#c">c</a><a name="bc" id="bc"></a></sup> over the many years, then the most likely source is  water-containing rocky asteroids arriving mostly as the planet was formed and soon afterward  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1015">1015</a><a name="r1015" id="r1015"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2172">2172</a><a name="r2172" id="r2172"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2173">2173</a><a name="r2173" id="r2173"></a>]. We think that nascent planetary systems may all have the same water resources as                          we did [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2203">2203</a><a name="r2203" id="r2203"></a>]; water that formed before our Sun was born. Therefore, life is likely to be widely established throughout the Universe.</p>

      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <p>Although many have tried, there is no simple definition of life [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2543">2543</a><a name="r2543" id="r2543"></a>]. Life is far from any equilibrium state and requires the continual input of energy; it is no longer 'alive' at equilibrium. In the beginning, 'life' entailed little of what is required today within our complex ecology; just a coating to separate it from the outside world, a primary metabolism involving energy input, growth, and self-replication  as there was no competition for resources. After a very slow beginning over hundreds of millions of years, competition with later-formed living beings and the necessity of new adaptations gave rise to the evolution of early   life forms similar to those we have more recently  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref43.html#r4248">4248</a><a name="r4248" id="r4248"></a>]. Life on Earth today is highly competitive and must show most of the following: reproduction, organization, metabolism, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, growth, protection, and adaptation. These requirements necessitate  the presence of a liquid to allow ease of molecular interactions and for reactions to proceed. We now know that life requires a flow of energy within an aqueous environment  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2532">2532</a><a name="r2532" id="r2532"></a>] (see also '<a href="water_life.html">Water and life</a>'). Life is truly remarkable, and although we understand (in outline) how it continues, we still do not know how it started.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are the four most prevalent reactive elements in the Universe that are available for life. Carbon is the most important, producing an enormous range of compounds (organic chemistry).    Life on Earth contains these plus many other commonly found elements. These elements (except hydrogen) are created inside stars and, if widespread, form  simple compounds in space. Spacial dust particles contain up to 35% organic carbon. For creating life, molecules need to be relatively easy to create and  break down, and to be relatively stable within a liquid environment.  Other elements such as sulfur and silicon, cannot form the complexity of molecules necessary for life. Silicon, in particular, tends to form stable silicates.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A stable liquid medium is required for life, such as water  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1011">1011</a><a name="r1011" id="r1011"></a>]. Other candidate liquids such as N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, NH<sub>3</sub>, <sup><a href="astrobiology.html#a">a</a><a name="ba" id="ba"></a></sup> and <a href="amorphous_ice.html#e" title="go for an explanation" >glass</a>y silica are liquid only at low temperatures giving slow reaction rates, or at high temperatures  that are destructive and too viscous. Also, many of these putative media <a href="density_anomalies.html#melt" title="go for more information" >freeze from the bottom up</a> which would  prevent the establishment of life. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Water is an excellent solvent for salts and polar molecules. Additionally, it has an enormous cosmic abundance,  a high <a href="thermodynamic_anomalies.html#vap" title="go for more information" >enthalpy of vaporization</a>, a <a href="phase_anomalies.html#Bpt" title="go for more information" >wide area of liquidity,</a> and a<a href="material_anomalies.html#diel" title="go for more information" > high  dielectric constant</a>; all critical attributes. Thus, mobile liquid water is necessary for the persistence of  life.&nbsp; However, where liquid water does not exist, such as on Mars,  sufficiently mobile water is still obtainable from the amorphous surfaces of ice  crystals and the so-called <a href="polysaccharide_hydration.html#alt" title="go for more information" >&lsquo;bound&rsquo; water</a> at interfaces with potential organic  molecules and inorganic salts and surfaces. Water in the crystalline ice  lattice will not be directly available. The exobiological life that evolves from a  liquid water-rich environment to one that is water-poor due to climatic change  would need to utilize mechanisms for holding on to its precious mobile water.  Such mechanisms are likely to involve highly hydrophilic molecules to  prevent water from escaping and  garner water molecules from the environment. </p>

    <h2><a name="origin" id="origin"></a>How life originated</h2>
    <p>Some microbial life can continue, if slowly, under extreme conditions on Earth, such as several kilometers underground (e.g., the cryptoendoliths, see<a href="astrobiology.html#crypto"> below</a>) or at -20&nbsp;&deg;C, or 35 km above the ground. Their survival without growth is possible in liquid N<sub>2</sub> (77 K), and dry bacterial spores have  survived temperatures down to10 K (outer space). Life may have developed (and died) around stars that no longer exist. Life could, therefore, have spread around the Universe (panspermia). It has been proposed that the possible spreading of life via such spores, would be contained within galaxies due to the limits of solar photon pressure as a driving force  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3619">3619</a><a name="r3619" id="r3619"></a>]. Microbial life from space would generally have difficulty establishing itself on a planet with already well-evolved life forms but might quickly establish itself on a planet with metabolizable substrates but no native life-forms.  In any case, the origin(s) of life still presents a puzzle.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With liquid water being available on a crusted Earth by 4.1 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>, life probably <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20161026-the-secret-of-how-life-on-earth-began"  title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin1" onclick="newWin('otherWin1')">originated on Earth</a> about 4.0 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>. However, there is no record as no sedimentary rocks exist from that time. How life arose on Earth is unknown, maybe from Mars (see <a href="astrobiology.html#mars">below</a>). <sup><a href="astrobiology.html#b">b</a><a name="bab" id="bb"></a></sup> How life originated anywhere is unknown. Indeed, the conditions on the early Earth would have been very hostile for most organisms that exist today, with an evolving but reducing atmosphere [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2675">2675</a><a name="r2675" id="r2675"></a>]. Carbon dioxide dominated the early atmosphere, but with evolving amounts of ammonia, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, water vapor, sulfur dioxide, methane, and hydrogen sulfide but always very little oxygen. First, a chemical soup would be formed in warm water by reactions from simpler precursors, e.g., hydrogen, methane, formaldehyde, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and phosphate. Liquid water is an excellent medium for forming such inorganic and organic materials in the presence of ultraviolet light or lightning. </p>

    <p>The Miller-Urey experimental set-up synthesized amino acids and nucleic bases, such as alanine (CH<sub>3</sub>CHNH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>CO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> ) (see right [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2523">2523</a><a name="r2523" id="r2523"></a>]; for synthetic routes, see [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2524">2524</a><a name="r2524" id="r2524"></a>]). Similar molecules are found in Mercury's polar ice.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Also, water ice can act as a substrate and irradiated reactant within interstellar clouds of gas and dust, enabling the formation of critical inorganic materials, such as HCN, and organic compounds, such as the carbon hydrates methanal (formaldehyde, H<sub>2</sub>C=O ), ethanoic acid (acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H), methyl methanoate (methyl formate, CH<sub>3</sub>OCOCH) and 2-hydroxy acetaldehyde (glycoladehyde, HO-CH<sub>2</sub>-CH=O), that are essential precursors to life.  Much of this chemistry occurs in &ldquo;dense&rdquo; interstellar clouds and protostellar disks surrounding forming stars  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4349">4349</a><a name="r4349" id="r4349"></a>]. These may  have eventually formed part of comets and asteroids in the early Solar System [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2525">2525</a><a name="r2525" id="r2525"></a>]. Additional organics still fall to Earth from space from meteorites and micrometeorite particles (0.02 - 0.4 mm) that currently bring 50,000,000 kg of material, containing organic carbon, to the Earth each year; intact as most float down. Much more is expected to have fallen in the far past.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Precursors of ribonucleotides, amino acids, and lipids can all be produced from hydrogen cyanide  via simple organics and molecules such as glyceraldehyde [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2662">2662</a><a name="r2662" id="r2662"></a>]. Starting with just six available primordial substrates (H<sub>2</sub>O, N<sub>2</sub>, HCN, NH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>S), tens of thousands of prebiotic  molecules, including fatty acids, polyaminoacids, nucleic acids, and nucleoside monophosphates, may be synthesized  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref41.html#r4086">4086</a><a name="r4086" id="r4086"></a>]. The biotic molecules formed tend to be more hydrophilic, more thermodynamically stable, and more balanced in terms of the hydrogen bond donors and acceptors they contain and are synthesizable along routes with fewer changes of conditions than the majority abiotic molecules.    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All cellular subsystems could have arisen simultaneously through a common chemistry, with key reaction steps  driven by ultraviolet light and  using hydrogen sulfide or molecular hydrogen  as the reductant. The early high concentrations of hydrogen gas would have led to easier syntheses and greater stabilities than are now possible within our more hostile oxidizing environment. Early life would probably have contained the more robust molecules only. Although such reactions would benefit from catalysts, and such catalysts (such as Cu(I)&ndash;Cu(II) photo redox cycling [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2662">2662</a>], or the Fe(II)&ndash;Fe(III) cycle mentioned below) are feasibly present, long lag periods are available on the early Earth for these materials to form in quantity without great catalysis.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;    </p>
    <p>In the absence of microbial life,  pools of organic materials would concentrate and become more complex, perhaps in hydrothermal pores [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2617">2617</a><a name="r2617" id="r2617"></a>]. One of the first crucial molecules must have been the autocatalyst that could reproduce itself. So long as degradative catalysts were not prevalent, these could be inorganic, such as polyphosphates, or similar to the still-extant autocatalysts RNA or protein. This process is likely to have been  slowly evolving, involving a sequence of improving autocatalysts. The accepted most likely route would be through RNA-like molecules [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3062">3062</a><a name="r3062" id="r3062"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> In the beginning, 'life' entailed little of what is required today within our complex and competitive ecology; just a primary metabolism, growth, and reproduction, as there was not the competition for resources that we have today. The origin of life is likely to follow the following steps. First, energy, likely from ultra-violet light, would have been coupled to some essential reactions, catalyzed by redox minerals. Coated cells containing the energy couple were likely to grow and devide, purely by chemical reactions. Over time the catalysts would improve 'naturally', and the cells would compete  for resources. Different cells would evolve to make different molecules and 'merge' to produce competitive multicomponent cells. Synthetic reactions would be more accessible then, in the reducing atmosphere, than now within our oxidizing atmosphere. &lsquo;Cells&rsquo; would probably &lsquo;live&rsquo; for long periods as there was a very slow breakdown at that time. The likely main building blocks for the chemical synthesis of biological molecules were formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, both of which were 'easily' formed at that time. Reactions would have been quicker in hot pools, but products would be less stable there unless cooled. Eventually, a type of 'RNA'  formed that could both catalyze its own duplication and other reactions. Different cells with different &lsquo;RNA&rsquo; would form communities and then merge and compete better. Eventually, life more like ours would emerge. Unfortunately, we cannot presently say whether the origin of life requires a week, a month, or a year, much less 50 million or a billion years, highlighting our ignorance of some of the&nbsp;critical steps in this process. </p>    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The earliest known life forms were thermophiles that could survive the more frequent violent impacts by sizeable solar system debris before 3.8 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a> with the oldest  fossil microorganisms found in Greenland (in 1-4 cm high microbial communities; stromatolites [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2707">2707</a><a name="r2707" id="r2707"></a>]), dated back to about 3.7 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>. Such organisms would have to survive in an anoxic atmosphere until 2.4 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga,</a> most likely using  sulfur and iron chemistry  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2599">2599</a><a name="r2599" id="r2599"></a>]. </p>

    <p>Likely places for this to happen are hydrothermal vents, either underwater or, perhaps more likely, above sea level [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2674">2674</a><a name="r2674" id="r2674"></a>]. If submarine, they can form 'black smokers' (see left) and 'white smokers', usually surrounded by a vibrant ecology. Above sea level, they are hydrothermal impact crater lakes [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2711">2711</a><a name="r2711" id="r2711"></a>], volcanic fumaroles (see <a href="astrobiology.html#fumarole">above right</a>), or warm little pools [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3062">3062</a>]. In such cases, there is  a constant supply of warmth, water and nutrient. The temperature was important as there was a much weaker Sun than we have today. However, if above sea level, there is the addition of the atmosphere, extensive gas-liquid interfaces, sunlight and associated photochemistry, and no restriction in the distribution and loss of products in the vastness of the early oceans. Today, such fumaroles show a richer diversity of life forms than other niches even high in the Atacama desert, one of the most inhospitable places on Earth [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2659">2659</a><a name="r2659" id="r2659"></a>]. An additional factor promoting life is likely to have been the occasional drying out of such pools  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4176">4176</a><a name="r4176" id="r4176"></a>]. Life starting in the early abundance of fumaroles could then spread straightforwardly through rivers to the oceans.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Investigations have been made of the possible prebiotic reactions within the nano-confined conditions  found in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Here,  layered mineral cracks are intercalated by water and hot high-pressure conditions occur. As a result, many reactions associated with peptide formation are found [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3174">3174</a><a name="r3174" id="r3174"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Water seems to be crucial to the origin of life. It  organizes molecules using its structure, the structure of its ices, and the interfaces between liquid water with solids and gases. Possibly, following the initial formation of methane (from H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>) <a href="clathrate_hydrates.html" title="go for more information" >clathrate hydrates</a> under pressure, reactions within the clathrate shells with phosphate and nitrate  form ribonucleic acids as the catalysts and blueprint for life [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2526">2526</a><a name="r2526" id="r2526"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Indeed, once life starts, it  continues  to be water-based, with even land animals commencing their lives within aqueous environments such as eggs. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of the features of life on Earth is the predominance of specific chiral isomers, <sup><a href="astrobiology.html#d">d</a><a name="bd" id="bd"></a></sup> such as the L-amino acids and D-sugars. Chirality initially seems surprising if it arose from simple chemical reactions that usually produce equal amounts of the left- and right-handed chiral products if not in contact with a previously chiral material. Water clusters are often chiral [<a name="r3164" id="r3164"></a><a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3164">3164</a>], but there are equal numbers of right and left-handed forms [<a  href="ref28.html#r2774" name="r2774" title="go to cited reference" id="r2774">2774</a>]. It now seems likely that chiral products can be produced in a system solely driven by autocatalysis to reach global homochirality  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2598">2598</a><a name="r2598" id="r2598"></a>]. Surprisingly, there is an excess of D-sugar derivatives such as D-gluconic acid (over the L forms) in carbonaceous meteorites that are the same age as the solar system (4.5 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a>) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2708">2708</a><a name="r2708" id="r2708"></a>]. The reason for the excess is undetermined, but the effect of circularly-polarized light during synthesis may be the cause, as might the asymmetric distribution of neutrinos emitted by a supernova.  <sup><a href="astrobiology.html#e">e</a><a name="be" id="be"></a></sup></p>

    <p align="left">One way to attempt to discover the earliest organisms on Earth is to look within extant organisms for common ancestors of all life.

    <h2><a name="universe" id="universe"></a>How many planets with life in the Universe?</h2>
    <p>Although there is some dispute, the Universe is thought to be about 93 billion light-years across and contains  something like 10<sup>11</sup> to 10<sup>12</sup> stars in our Galaxy, and there are perhaps something like 2 &#739; 10<sup>12</sup> galaxies, with each star having on average one planet. Therefore there are about  10<sup>23</sup> to 10<sup>24</sup> planets. However, many of these will not be in their system's habitable zone [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2527">2527</a><a name="r2527" id="r2527"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A planet in the habitable zone has no guarantee of actually being habitable. Venus and Earth are both within the Sun&rsquo;s habitable zone and would appear from current exoplanet discovery techniques to be the same size and mass. Nevertheless, Venus is entirely hostile to life owing to its high surface temperatures (462&nbsp;&nbsp;&deg;C), whereas Earth has the correct surface temperature for liquid water with oceans  teeming with life. The habitable zone could exist from about 0.5 AU  to about 5 AU (would include Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter in the solar system) for a solar-type star, or even beyond, depending on the planet&rsquo;s interior, its mass, and its atmospheric characteristics. The existence of liquid water is probably insufficient, in itself, for life, with very deep water-covered planets being unsuitable due to the loss of material to high-pressure ice environments at depth and so restricting life forms[<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2574">2574</a><a name="r2574" id="r2574"></a>]. As such, there is no universal habitable zone applicable to all exoplanets.  In all likelihood, about one in every hundred planets would be both within the zone and suitable for life. That still gives at least 10<sup>20</sup> planets suitable for life in the Universe. Even the oceans below the icy surfaces of Jupiter's moons  Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede, and Saturn's moons Enceladus and Titan may hold primitive life  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref39.html#r3859">3859</a><a name="r3859" id="r3859"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some argue that, although microbial-like life may be much more common, life as complex as  on Earth is extremely rare in the Universe. In our case, it seems to require an improbable set of   circumstances involving having a large moon, plate tectonics,   a magnetic field, a gas giant like Jupiter for protection, and an orbit within   the habitable zone of the right kind of star [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2567">2567</a><a name="r2567" id="r2567"></a>]. However, these restrictions seem too great [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2568">2568</a><a name="r2568" id="r2568"></a>] as our Sun is a commonly found star type (G-type main-sequence star that fuses hydrogen to helium for about 10 billion years, also known as a yellow dwarf, &asymp; 10% of known stars), Jupiter-sized planets seem common at about the same position, a large moon may not be necessary, and there are many other uncertainties. Even if only one suitable planet existed per galaxy, there would still be a hundred billion  suitable planets.</p>

    <p>It appears that suitable conditions were available on Mars up to about 4 <a href="constants.html#ga">Ga</a> when Mars seems to have had sufficient groundwater and atmosphere for life to evolve. However, the conditions on Mars have been much more demanding over the last billion years or so, with the loss of much of the atmosphere, the prevalence of much colder conditions, and the apparent disappearance of much of the water. However,  pictures from the Phoenix Mars Lander (<strong>b</strong>, right) show ground conditions similar to those in permafrost regions of Earth where life still flourishes  (<strong>a</strong>, right). Thus, athough it seems highly unlikely that life currently exists on Mars, it is possible to hypothesize life forms that could have adapted to these conditions  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3132">3132</a><a name="r3132" id="r3132"></a>]. </p>

    <p>By analyzing  the relative humidities, air temperatures, and ground temperatures  from the Curiosity rover at Gale Crater on Mars, support was found for the formation of night-time transient liquid brines in the uppermost 5 cm of the subsurface that then evaporates after sunrise [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2531">2531</a><a name="r2531" id="r2531"></a>]. The distribution of water in the ground surface is shown in this false-color map of Mars (below), where deep blue indicates  water or ice deposits. Most of this water resides at the poles. Mars, today, is a frozen desert with only about 10 ml of precipitable water per square meter of surface. The atmospheric water vapor content averages only about 0.1 <a href="constants.html#Pa">Pa</a> at 220 K, with this water coming from the sublimation of the polar ice caps. </p>

    <p>Water is presently associated with minerals or as sub-surface deposits, with occasional flows of  liquid water on the surface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2529">2529</a><a name="r2529" id="r2529"></a>], the formation of night-time transient liquid brines in the uppermost 5 cm of the subsurface that then evaporates after sunrise [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2530">2530</a><a name="r2530" id="r2530"></a>], and the discovery of ice cliffs in 2018 [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3159">3159</a><a name="r3159" id="r3159"></a>].</p>

Organisms must then be able to access this water, utilize it as a mobile liquid and keep hold of it against adverse changes in conditions and, perhaps, substitute for it during periods of more extreme drought during such periods of dormancy as are required. There are several ways by which water can be held against extremely low vapor pressures. For example, by controlling pH, water can be held firmly by some salts for later use (e.g., Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>, see above right). </p>

    <p>On Mars, life forms would also be expected to  use  this process, perhaps for very extensive periods. During such periods, life forms would lie dormant as biological processes cannot continue, except perhaps at an extremely sluggish rate.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The continuance of life requires mobile liquid water. Such water can exist far below the freezing point of pure water due to capillarity, pressure, or colligative freezing point depression effects lowering the <a href="water_activity.html">water activity</a>. When materials dissolve in water, the freezing point decreases in line with the mole fraction of water. Thus free liquid water may be available down to -50&nbsp;&deg;C (see right) so long as there is sufficient solute available. If the temperature is higher, then less solute is required.</p>

    <p>Life on Earth can persist even in icy and dry Antarctic deserts and has been revived from clay samples drilled from beneath the South Pacific after over 10,000,000 years. These harsh conditions, however, present more comfortable conditions for life than those found on Mars. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Life on Mars must be surrounded by a sheath that achieves two aims, attracting and binding scarce water and protecting against Mars's prevalent ultraviolet radiation. It would likely consist of layers, with the outer layers binding the water most strongly and the inner (life) layer allowing some aqueous mobility. </p>

     <p><a name="crypto" id="crypto"></a> Therefore, life on Mars, if extant, is likely to show similarities to  some of Earth&rsquo;s microorganisms, such as the cryptoendoliths that survive as extremophile microbial communities. On Earth, these are a combination of fungi and algae that grow inside transparent rock just a few millimeters under the surface (see cross-section right). They can shut down metabolically. Individual organisms are capable of  surviving hundreds of years of intense cold and drought. In addition, an outer iron mineral layer could offer protection from UV light.</p>

<p>Martian life could have evolved several billion years ago when conditions were much kinder. However, today such life has to survive within an anaerobic, water-sparse, ultraviolet-lit and extremely cold  environment. Thus, a possible metabolic mechanism is given left, where the energy input comes from the UV, causing the separation of electrons and positive 'holes' in hematite. Such a metabolism utilizes methane, the gas that is currently sought by the joint<a href="http://mars.nasa.gov/programmissions/missions/future/exomarsorbiter2016/"  target="otherWin1" onclick="newWin('otherWin1')" title="go to the external page"> European/ Russian ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO</a>), that lifted off from Baikonur in Kazakhstan on 14 March 2016. CH<sub>4</sub>-rich clathrate hydrates are expected to be a subsurface source of some of this methane  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3375">3375</a><a name="r3375" id="r3375"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Based on  this scenario, life forms on Mars would be expected to have an essential one-carbon metabolism. On Earth, such metabolism  uses  a cobalt-containing coenzyme, so it may be fruitful to look for pockets of cobalt concentrations within the surface rocks of Mars. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Much of the above may be moot as, in 2018, permanent liquid water was found on Mars. A large saltwater lake (20 kilometers across) was found under 1.5 km thick ice near Mars&rsquo;s south pole. On Earth, similar, if less salty,'subglacia' lakes in Antarctica are home to microbial life [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3373">3373</a><a name="r3373" id="r3373"></a>].</p>
