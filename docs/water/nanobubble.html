    <h2><a name="bubbles" id="bubbles"></a>Bubbles</h2>
    <p>Bubbles [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2937">2937</a><a name="r2937" id="r2937"></a>] are gas-filled cavities within liquids (and solids; here, we deal with liquids only). They act as a gas reserve in addition to the dissolved gas. In liquids, bubbles have internal equilibrium pressures at least that of the external environment. In water, such bubbles contain saturated water vapor with 100% relative humidity. Each bubble is surrounded by an interface that possesses different properties to that of the bulk solution.
      Surfactants can stabilize bubbles of all sizes [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2942">2942</a><a name="r2942" id="r2942"></a>], but bubbles may also be formed without them. Large bubbles (&gt;100 &micro; diameter) rise rapidly (&gt; 6 mm &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and directly to the surface. As the bubble's surface area per contained volume increases in proportion to its diameter, microbubbles ( 1 &micro;  - 100 &micro; diameter) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3204">3204</a><a name="r3204" id="r3204"></a>] provide a higher surface area per unit volume than the commonly seen larger bubbles. They may be produced by numerous methods and have been used for sludge solubilization, water purification, treatment of wastewater, drug delivery, and as contrast agent together with ultrasound. <sup><a href="nanobubble.html#l">l</a></sup><a name="bl" id="bl"></a> They are not stable for extended   periods (~ minutes), rising slowly (10<sup>&minus;3</sup> - 10 mm &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and indirectly to the surface, but smaller ones (&asymp; &lt; 20 &micro; diameter) will shrink to form more effective and stable nanobubbles. Only these tiny bubbles (&lt; 1 &micro;m diameter) <sup><a href="nanobubble.html#j">j</a></sup><a name="bj" id="bj"></a> are stable for significant periods in suspension (rising at less than 10<sup>&minus;2</sup> &micro;m &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup> but with this counteracted by Brownian motion of greater than 1 &micro;m &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>), with larger or smaller bubbles disappearing rapidly from aqueous suspensions unless stabilized with surface-active agents. They are normally and commonly present in lower amounts in aqueous solutions. Their presence is necessary  as  cavitation nuclei in pure water, particularly when it does not contain any foreign microparticles and the vessel is without any wall defects  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2822">2822</a><a name="r2822" id="r2822"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Nanobubbles (for a history, see [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2745">2745</a><a name="r2745" id="r2745"></a>]) are generally recognized in the current (2018 and earlier) scientific literature as those gaseous cavities with diameters less than a micron. As such cavities (bubbles) are often greater than 100 nm in diameter, but the term 'nano' is applied mostly to particles of smaller diameter (&lt; 100 nm, <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68187.html" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin24" onclick="newWin('otherWin24')">ISO 20480-1:2017</a>),  sub-micron bubbles should probably be known as ultrafine bubbles in the future; all bubbles smaller than 100 &micro;m diameter should then be known as 'fine' bubbles. In this website, we use the term 'nanobubble' as it is still more widely used in the literature. </p>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The surface area of a volume of bubbles is in inverse proportion to the bubble diameter. Thus for the same volume of bubble, their surface area (<span class="style6"><strong>A</strong></span>) increases proportionally to the reduction in bubble diameter (<span class="style6"><strong>D</strong></span>; <span class="style6"><strong>A</strong></span> = 6/<span class="style6"><strong>D</strong></span>); for example, one mL of 100 nm radius bubbles (2&#739;10<sup>15</sup> bubbles) has 1000 times more surface (60 m<sup>2</sup>) than one mL of 0.1 mm bubbles (2&#739;10<sup>6</sup> bubbles,   0.06 m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Basic theory (see <a href="nanobubble.html#charge">later</a>) states that the energy cost of bubble formation depends upon the interfacial area and is governed by the bubble's surface tension. Small bubbles (&lt; 25 &micro;m diameter) have taut inflexible surfaces (like high-pressure balloons) that limit distortion since large bubbles (&asymp; mm diameter) have flexible surfaces (like low-pressure balloons) and can divide (break up) relatively quickly.  The buoyancy of larger bubbles will cause them to rise to the surface of aqueous solutions. </p>

    <p>Stokes' equation is valid for particles at low Reynolds number and governs the rising rate (R = rise rate, m  &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>): <sup><a href="nanobubble.html#a">a</a></sup><a name="ba" id="ba"></a></p>

    <p align="center"><strong>R = &rho;gd<sup>2</sup>/18&mu;</strong></p>

    <p>where  &rho; = density (kg   &#739; m<sup>&minus;3</sup>), g = gravity (m   &#739; s<sup>&minus;2</sup>), d = bubble diameter (m), and &mu; = dynamic viscosity (<a href="constants.html#Pa">Pa</a> &#739; s); according to this relationship, a 2.5 &mu;m diameter bubble rises 100 times slower (&asymp; 0.2 mm   &#739; min<sup>&minus;1</sup>) than a 25 &mu;m diameter bubble (&asymp; 2.3 cm   &#739; min<sup>&minus;1</sup>) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1966">1966</a><a name="r1966" id="r1966"></a>], and a  nanobubble rises much more slowly than its random (<a href="Brownian.html">Brownian</a>) motion. The actual behavior of bubbles is more complex than this, however, with experiments rarely showing good agreement with the Stokes equation. The <a href="Brownian.html">Brownian</a> movement velocities are given by the equation</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center">v = <img src="images/brown23.gif" alt="" width="60" height="55" align="absmiddle" /></p>
    <p>where <em>R</em> is the <a href="constants.html#gas">gas constant</a> (J &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; K<sup>&minus;1</sup>; kg &#739; m<sup>2</sup> &#739; s<sup>&minus;2</sup> &#739; K<sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>), <em>T</em> is the temperature (K), <em>N</em> is the <a href="constants.html#avoga">Avogadro constant</a>, <em>&eta;</em> is the <a href="rheology.html#dyn">dynamic viscosity</a> (Pa 
      &#739; s; kg &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>), <em>r</em> is the averaged particle radius (m), and t is the measurement time (here taken as one second for comparison to the bubble rise velocities).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Bubbles less than 1 &mu;m diameter rise so slowly that the rate is not determinable. This is due to their random <a href="Brownian.html">Brownian motion</a> and their low buoyancy. Accumulation of denser elements at the smaller bubbles' extensive surfaces may contribute significantly to the low buoyancy of such tiny bubbles. Larger bubbles (25-200 &mu;m diameter) do not obey the above Stokes equation but the Hadamard and Rybczynski equation with terminal velocity 1.5 times the Stokes velocity  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2385">2385</a><a name="r2385" id="r2385"></a>]: </p>
    <p align="center"><strong>R<sub>H-R</sub> = 3R/2 = &rho;gd<sup>2</sup>/12&mu;</strong></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This is due to interfacial oscillations as the surface area increases, and this surface becomes less taut. Bubbles larger than about 0.2 mm rise at rates proportional to their diameter (<strong>R<sub>d=0.2-2 mm</sub> = 120 d</strong>, m   &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>). Bubbles larger than about 2 mm diameter rise rapidly at almost the same rate irrespective of diameter (<strong>R<sub>d&gt;2mm</sub> = &asymp; 0.25</strong> m  &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup>)  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2386">2386</a><a name="r2386" id="r2386"></a>]. Larger bubbles (&asymp; &gt; 0.2 mm) undergo significant shape changes on rising through the solution due to the frictional resistance of the liquid. All these rise velocities are relevant to low concentrations of bubbles. Where the solution has high bubble concentrations, the bubbles may  physically interfere with each other and rise more slowly.</p>

    <p>In addition to and in competition to the effect of buoyancy, small bubbles (&lt;25-50 &micro;m diameter) shrink (see right [<a href="ref21.html#r2068">2068</a><a name="r2068" id="r2068"></a>]), such that the overall behavior of micro-bubbles is complex. Light scattering under dark-field microscopy (DFM) has been used to show the collapsing micro-bubbles down to nanobubbles. Micro-bubbles carrying a different type of gas (xenon, air and sulfur hexafluoride) displayed different shrinkage, but the final nanobubbles are similar, showing Brownian motion  independent of the  gas  [<a href="ref41.html#r4014">4014</a><a name="r4014" id="r4014"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The degree of saturation next to a bubble depends on the gas pressure within the bubble. Smaller bubbles have higher internal pressure (see below) and release gas to dissolve under pressure into the surrounding under-saturated solution  whereas larger bubbles grow by taking up gas from supersaturated solution; thus small bubbles shrink, and large bubbles grow (a process known as 'Ostwald ripening'). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <img src="images/bubble4.gif" alt="Evolution of bubbles" title="Evolution of bubbles" width="280" height="217" class="floatleft" /></figure>
    <p>The rates of these processes depend on the circumstances. Also, as bubbles rise, the pressure on them drops due to the depth of the water, and they consequentially grow and rise faster.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The electrostatic interactions between nanobubbles in water are usually significant enough to prevent coalescence   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1966">1966</a>] and slow any rise. The charges on the bubbles are determined from their horizontal velocity (<em>v</em>, m<sup>2</sup> &#739; s<sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; V<sup>&minus;1</sup>) in a horizontal electric field, where </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><strong><em>v</em> = &zeta;&epsilon;/&mu;</strong> </p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>where &zeta; = zeta potential (V), &epsilon; = permittivity of water (s<sup>2</sup> &#739; <a href="constants.html#C">C</a><sup>2</sup> &#739; kg<sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; m<sup>&minus;3</sup>), and &mu; = dynamic viscosity (Pa   &#739; s). The zeta potential is generally negative. Although mostly reported as independent of the bubble diameter, some analyses show that  more negative zeta potential is generally consistent with smaller nanobubble hydrodynamic size. It depends strongly on the pH (see <a href="interfacial_water.html#f">graph elsewhere</a>) and the dissolved salt concentrations (increased <a href="water_dissociation.html#o">ionic strength</a> reduces zeta potential). A similar negative charge on all the bubbles  discourages their coalescence. Also, their division is not favored unless there is considerable energy input, with smaller bubbles requiring greater energy (see <a href="nanobubble.html#divide"> below</a>). Thus, small bubbles can grow or contract but rarely coalesce or divide. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Insoluble gases may form nanobubbles that are stable indefinitely in water [<a  href="ref27.html#r2638" name="r2638" title="go to cited reference" id="r3">2638</a>]. For soluble gases, the pressure inside gas cavities  is inversely proportional to their diameter, and given by the Laplace equation, </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"> <strong>P<sub>in</sub> &nbsp;= P<sub>out</sub> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;4&gamma;/d</strong></p>
    <p align="center"><strong><br />
      P<sub>excess </sub>= 4&gamma;/d </strong> </p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>where P<sub>in</sub> and P<sub>out</sub> are the  respective cavity internal 
      and external pressures, &gamma; is the <a href="water_properties.html#Surface_tension">surface tension</a> (<a href="constants.html#N" title="newton">N</a> &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>), and d is the cavity diameter (m). The external pressure is governed by the atmospheric pressure and the depth of the bubble. Thus 10 &micro;m and 100 &micro;m bubbles contain gas at about 1.3 and 1.03 <a href="constants.html#bar">bar</a> respectively in water. Where the external pressure is negative,, and surfactant is present, such as within long-distance water transport in the xylem of plants (see <a href="ice_xvi.html#a">negative pressure</a>), stable water-vapor-containing nanobubbles are formed [<a  href="ref33.html#r3258" name="r3258" title="go to cited reference" id="r3258">3258</a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This Laplace equation is simply derived by equating the free energy change on increasing the surface area of a spherical cavity </p>

    <p>For nanobubbles the calculated internal gas pressure should cause their almost instantaneous dissolution using early theory [<a  href="ref27.html#r2639" name="r2639" title="go to cited reference" id="r4">2639</a>], <sup><a href="nanobubble.html#i">i</a></sup><a name="bi" id="bi"></a> but as nanobubbles are now known to exist for long periods, this basic theory must be insufficient. It is not certain 
      that the Laplace equation holds at very small radii  [<a  href="ref12.html#r1129" name="r1129" title="go to cited reference" id="r5">1129</a>, <a  href="ref19.html#r1807" name="r1807" title="go to cited reference" id="r6">1807</a>], but it does hold for H<sub>2</sub> nanobubbles above 10-nm radius [<a  href="ref33.html#r3272" name="r3272" title="go to cited reference" id="r3272">3272</a>]. It has been shown that surface tension may increase almost 20-fold to 1.3 N &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup> for 150 nm diameter droplets [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r823">823</a><a name="r823" id="r7"></a>] in the absence of other effectors such as surface charge. Thus, the Laplace equation appears correct down to about a nanometer or so, below which a small correction must be applied [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1271">1271</a><a name="r1271" id="r8"></a>]. However, there may well be further contributions to the work required, due to the removal of surface-bound material, as the surface area contracts, that would lower the excess pressure.  In the absence of any other surface effects such as solute interactions  or charges, the excess pressures expected in a  50 nm radius spherical nanobubble and a 50 nm diameter surface nanobubble (r<sub>S</sub> = 50 nm, r = 1000 nm), due to the surface tension minimizing the cavity surface, are 5.8 MPa and 0.14 MPa respectively. It has been proposed that supersaturation around the nanobubbles may significantly lower the surface tension,  allowing stable nanobubbles [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2013">2013</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> The pressure within nanobubbles is affected by other factors and is possibly much lower than expected from the Laplace equation. The gas-liquid interface of bubbles may be deliberately (or fortuitously) coated with surface-active materials, such as protein or detergent, that lower the surface tension and hence the excess pressure  stabilizies the bubbles. The presence and concentration of surface-active agents  regulate the the  size of the bubbles. Such coated microbubbles/nanobubbles are &lsquo;armoured&rsquo; [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref44.html#r4319">4319</a><a name="r4319" id="r4319"></a>].with a substantial coating of poorly soluble material and used as ultrasound contrast agents  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2483">2483</a><a name="r2483" id="r2483"></a>] or for targeted drug delivery [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2383">2383</a><a name="r2383" id="r2383"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>An increase in static pressure on bulk nanobubbles caused their number concentration  to decrease but their mean size to increase  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3179">3179</a><a name="r3179" id="r3179"></a>],. Both these parameters undergo partial recoveries on the release of the pressure.</p>

    <p> Surface nanobubbles [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3715">3715</a><a name="r3715" id="r3715"></a>] are present at most aqueous surfaces with many more investigations  made into surface nanobubbles than bulk nanobubbles (see <a href="nanobubble.html#bulk">below</a>). These nanobubbles may be found in crevices (trapped nanobubbles) or on flat surfaces (surface nanobubbles) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3700">3700</a><a name="r3700" id="r3700"></a>]. Stability theories for nanobubbles at solid-liquid interfaces have been reviewed [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3259">3259</a><a name="r3259" id="r3259"></a>]. </p>

    <p>Surface nanobubbles may be formed by the solvent exchange procedure whereby a hydrophobic surface is first contacted with water which is then replaced by ethanol or a similar solvent. At this stage. No nanobubbles can be observed at this stage, but after the ethanol is replaced by water, surface nanobubbles are found [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3013">3013</a><a name="r3013" id="r3013"></a>]. They vary considerably in dimensions but typically they might have dimensions of r = 50 nm - 6 &micro;m, r<sub>S</sub> = 25 - 1000 nm, h = 5 - 20 nm (see right). They have greater contact angles (&theta; = 135&deg; - 175&deg;) than expected  from macroscopic bubble studies on the same hydrophobic surface. The excess internal pressure is not great when the bubble radius is greater than about a micron. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Surface nanobubbles explain the increased liquid slip at liquid-solid interfaces and the resulting lower drag [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1988">1988</a><a name="r1988" id="r1988"></a>]. Extended flat surface nanobubbles are known as micro- or nano-pancakes (1-2 nm in height). Surface nanobubbles and nano-pancakes are partially stabilized by processes that are not available to the bulk nanobubbles. For example, it is proposed that the three-phase line is fixed (called 'pinning'  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2747">2747</a><a name="r2747" id="r2747"></a>] with a force of about 0.1 &mu;N )   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2933">2933</a><a name="r2933" id="r2933"></a>]. This has been ascribed   to surface roughness  exacerbated by a surface charge-induced electrical double layer [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2748">2748</a><a name="r2748" id="r2748"></a>]. Here the Laplace pressure inside the nanobubbles decreases during dissolution and increases during growth so extending their lifetime. This pressure behavior is the opposite of that expected for freely floating bulk nanobubbles. Also, the hydrophobic wall repels  water,  raises the solubility of gas molecules, and increasies the surface radius (r<sub>S</sub>). Other mechanisms for the stability of surface nanobubbles without contact line pinning have been proposed  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3610">3610</a><a name="r3610" id="r3610"></a>]. It is also likely to be  partially due to possession of a negatively charged surface similar to that described for free-floating nanobubbles.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The lifetime of surface nanobubbles is so long that they are considered stable [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2108">2108</a>], and can withstand near-boiling temperatures  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2187">2187</a><a name="r2187" id="r2187"></a>]. Surface nanobubbles (diameter 200 - 600 nm) may be formed by microwaving solutions containing dissolved oxygen  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2664">2664</a><a name="r2664" id="r2664"></a>], probably due to localized surface heating. Nanobubbles also exist in undersaturated liquids, having  concave vapor-liquid interfaces with  negative curvature and hiding within surface defects  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2663">2663</a><a name="r2663" id="r2663"></a>]. Neighboring surface nanobubbles may stabilize each other (or, in some cases, destabilize each other) by gas exchange through connecting gas &quot;tunnels&quot; along the solid surface [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref39.html#r3806">3806</a><a name="r3806" id="r3806"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Nanobubbles are commonly found on solid hydrophobic surfaces in solutions open to the air, where they seem  quite stable [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1272">1272</a><a name="r1272" id="r1272"></a>] and may spread out to form pancake-like structures. Bulk nanobubbles are likely to be repelled from each other and from negatively charged hydrophilic surfaces at a distance. However, they may attach to such surfaces through water-separated films, if they closely approach [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1273">1273</a><a name="r1273" id="r1273"></a>]. Surface and bulk-phase nanobubbles can both give rise to the otherwise difficult to explain <a title="go for more information" href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#long">long-range attraction between hydrophobic surfaces</a>. As the temperature of aqueous solutions rises, the solubility of nonpolar gases drops, so increasing the gas released and nanobubble volume and surface coverage [<a href="ref9.html#r842">842</a><a name="r842" id="r842"></a>] but generally having a much lesser effect on nanobubble concentration. </p>

The very existence of bulk nanobubbles is still (mistakenly but vehemently) disputed by some surface nanobubble researchers. One group found that stable bulk nanobubbles require trace organic contaminants to form under their conditions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r3540">3540</a><a name="r3540" id="r3540"></a>] but other groups have found that nanobubbles form in pure water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3902">3902</a><a name="r3902" id="r3902"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3903">3903</a><a name="r3903" id="r3903"></a>]. Also, in some cases nanoparticles may be produced rather than nanobubbles [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r3546">3546</a><a name="r3546" id="r3546"></a>,<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3709"> 3709</a><a name="r3709" id="r3709"></a>]. However, it is now generally believed that  bulk nanobubbles are present in most aqueous solutions, possibly being continually created by agitation and cosmic radiation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2108">2108</a>,<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2109"> 2109</a><a name="r2109" id="r2109"></a>]. Their presence is significant  to the properties of many aqueous solutions. Their concentration increases on stirring and reduces on filtration or degassing [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2544">2544</a><a name="r2544" id="r2544"></a>]. Their size depends on the external pressure and their mass is very low, they can be distinguished from solid or liquid particles. Their formation and presence in microfluidics is a problem to be avoided  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3652">3652</a><a name="r3652" id="r3652"></a>]. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Stable bulk nanobubbles (diameter 40-300 nm) were first reported by the leading journal Nature, [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2468">2468</a><a name="r2468" id="r2468"></a>] in 1982. They were found in  the white cap of breaking waves by sonar observation. Although these bubbles are smaller than the wavelength of light and too small to be visible to the naked eye or standard microscope (given transparent solutions), they are visualized by backscattering of the light from a powerful green laser pointer (see <a href="nanobubble.html#laser">below</a>). Generally, as with larger bubbles, nanobubbles have  negative <a href="interfacial_water.html#b" title="go to more information">zeta potential</a> (&asymp;  -25 to -40 mV) in neutral solutions, as proven by electrophoretic light scattering. These nanobubbles may have far-reaching physical, chemical, and biological effects. They are under excess pressure as the <a  title="go for more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#ST">surface tension</a> causes a tendency to minimize their surface area and hence volume. Although often ignored, they are in constant flux, with many gas molecules continuously  leaving and entering the bubbles. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Nanobubbles have raised cavity pressure and grow or shrink by diffusion according to whether the surrounding solution  is over-saturated or under-saturated. Gas solubility   is proportional to the gas pressure. This  pressure, exerted by the surface tension in inverse proportion to the  diameter of the bubbles, increases significantly at small bubble  diameters. This dissolution process is, therefore, accelerated with an increasing tendency for  gases to  dissolve as the bubbles reduce in size. Such dissolution increases with the bubble's movement and contraction during this process, which aids the removal of any gas-saturated solution around the cavities. Early theoretical calculations showed that nanobubbles  should only persist for a few microseconds [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1268">1268</a><a name="r1268" id="r1268"></a>]. However, the ease with which water forms larger visible bubbles, under slight tensile pressure well below the <a href="water_properties.html#tensile">tensile strength of water</a>, and the greater difficulty that occurs on degassing both indicate the occurrence of gas-containing nanobubbles (cavities). Clusters of nanobubbles (bubstons) are proposed that are stabilized by ionic solutes (and magnetic fields [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2496">2496</a><a name="r2496" id="r2496"></a>]) and containing gas at atmospheric pressure  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1826">1826</a><a name="r1826" id="r1826"></a>]. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left"> A high density of nanobubbles has  been created in solution, and the heterogeneous mixture lasts for more than two weeks  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1618">1618</a><a name="r1618" id="r1618"></a>]. The total volume of gases in these nanobubble solutions reached about 1% v/v  under pressure in 1.9 &#739; 10<sup>16</sup> 50-nm radius nanobubbles (equivalent to about 600 cm<sup>3</sup> when converted to <a title="go for more information" href="constants.html#STP">standard temperature and pressure</a>) per liter of water. These bubbles reduced the liquid density  to about 0.988 g  &#739; cm<sup>&minus;3</sup> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1618">1618</a>]. Even higher concentrations have been reported on a small scale, as the result of electrolysis with rapid changes of the polarity. Concentrations of nanobubbles (&lt;200 nm) as high as 1.1  &#739; 10<sup>18</sup> &#739; L<sup>&minus;1</sup> with supersaturation of 500&#739; are reported    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3408">3408</a><a name="r3408" id="r3408"></a>]. Such nanobubbles contain both O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> gases. Surprisingly, these bubbles disappear quickly (without ignition but via the combustion reaction), although such small-volume reactions should not occur according to the classical combustion theory     [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref43.html#r4244">4244</a><a name="r4244" id="r4244"></a>]. The reaction is supposedly due to the surface-activated radical reactions,  forming H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The gas temperature never gets high enough for combustion as the heat produced by the reaction rapidly escapes due to the nanobubbles' very large  surface-to-volume ratio. Microbubbles formed from the coalescence of many nanobubbles support the 'normal' combustion reaction due to their much lower surface-to-volume ratio.</p>

    <p align="left">The surface tension of solutions containing large numbers of nanobubbles seems to be reduced by up to about 15% [<a href="ref21.html#r2067">2067</a><a name="r2067" id="r2067"></a>].

    <p>It matters whether the bubbles are described using the number of bubbles versus bubble size or the volume of bubbles versus bubble size; see left. The same bubble population appears as mainly nanobubbles if described using the number of bubbles centered at about 90 nm (see left bottom) but appears as a peak of much larger bubbles centered at about 800 nm  using the volume within the bubbles (see left top). There is a lesser peak in the volume distribution centered at about 130 nm and a  much smaller peak centered at about 700 nm in the number of bubbles peak. Note that the shapes of the peaks using these two metrics are also very different. These phenomena occur as the volume of a bubble increases as the cube of the bubble size.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Different gases give different size nanobubbles; e.g., in one study O<sub>3</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, air, and N<sub>2</sub> gave average diameter nanobubbles of 148 nm, 113 nm, 112 nm, and 102 nm in line with their <a href="interfacial_water.html#ions">zeta potentials</a> of -27 mV, -22 mV, -21 mV, and -20 mV respectively  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3717">3717</a><a name="r3717" id="r3717"></a>]. It has been found that the growth rate of the volume number density of nanobubbles is controlled by the magnitude of the molecular polarizability of dissolved gases [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref43.html#r4235">4235</a><a name="r4235" id="r4235"></a>].</p>

	  <p>Curved aqueous surfaces  may introduce a surface charge due to water&rsquo;s molecular structure or  its dissociation. The interfacial charge reduces the internal pressure and the apparent surface tension, with charge repulsion acting in the  opposite direction to the surface tension.<sup><a href="nanobubble.html#o">o</a><a name="bo" id="bo"></a></sup> Any increase in negatively-charged materials that favor the  gas-liquid interface, such as OH<sup>&minus;</sup> ions at neutral or basic pH or the application of negative ions with an anti-static gun that reduces nanobubble diameter  [<a href="ref21.html#r2066">2066</a><a name="r2066" id="r2066"></a>]. Using molecular dynamics, it has been shown that the nanobubbles are  charged with the electrostatic stress counteracting  a sufficient part of the surface tension [<a href="ref44.html#r4328">4328</a><a name="r4328" id="r4328"></a>]. Nanobubbles produced from CO<sub>2</sub>, with a high local concentration of negative bicarbonate  ions at their gas/liquid interfaces, are half the size (&asymp;  73 nm diameter after one hour mixing time)  of  commonly found nanobubbles  (&asymp;  150 nm diameter)  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2959">2959</a>]. Similarly charged surfaces, together with the lack of <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> attraction (the cavities possessing close to zero electron density), tend to prevent nanobubbles from coalescing. Negatively charged nanobubbles are common, but if the pH is made acidic (pH &lt; 4), the nanobubbles may be stabilized by positive charges   [<a href="ref44.html#r4321">4321</a><a name="r4321" id="r4321"></a>]. Note that a negatively charged nanobubble surface indicates that the bulk water will be positively charged and slightly more acidic. Also, the <a href="https://water.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_">pK<sub>w</sub></a> of the water surface will change [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref43.html#r4347">4347</a><a name="r4347" id="r4347"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="redox" id="redox"></a>It has been found that the air/water interface causes the spontaneous redox reduction of biomolecules including pyruvate, cystine, lipoic acid, and fumarate with up to &asymp; 95 % reduction efficiency. The extent of this scales with the surface area   [<a href="ref33.html#r3201">3201</a><a name="r3201" id="r3201"></a>], thus proving the reduction efficiency and the presence of excess electrons at the surface. Also, reactions with a high thermodynamic barrier can spontaneously occur, possibly by lowering the entropy change at the water surface [<a href="ref33.html#r3201">3201</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The  following analysis  shows that surface charge can counter the surface tension (see also [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2566">2566</a><a name="r2566" id="r2566"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2822">2822</a>]),  preventing high pressures within the nanobubbles. If the bubble reaches equilibrium, the charge density at the surface is required for stability. As the nanobubble shrinks, the charge density increases. During this process, some charge density is expelled to the bulk, but the extent  is unclear as energy is required for the expulsion,<sup><a href="nanobubble.html#d"> d</a><a name="bd" id="bd"></a></sup> and this must be less than the increase in energy due to the approach of the charges. In any case, surface charge density will always slow down the process of nanobubble collapse. Even at the equilibrium charge density, contained gas will dissolve if the solution interface is under-saturated (but <a href="nanobubble.html#expl">see above</a>). However, this is unlikely if the exposed liquid water surface is also in contact with similar gas at a similar pressure. A further factor is that the surface charge density is not uniform as it exists as distributed but discrete charges. Such a charge distribution is known to significantly affect the electric double layer structure close to the surface and the absolute values of the zeta potentials are increased   [<a href="ref44.html#r4395">4395</a><a name="r4395" id="r4395"></a>].</p>

    <p>The cartoon right illustrates the effect of charges at the  water/gas interface, with the negative  surface  charges repelling  each other  and so stretching out the surface.   The  charges  reduce the effect of the surface tension. The repulsive force between like charges  increases inversely as the square of their distances apart, the charges cause strongly increasing  pressure  outwards  as bubble diameter lessens. As well as tending to increase the nanobubble diameters, the surface charge will  also tend to increase the contact angles. The greater <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> attraction across the gas bubble also assists in flattening surface nanobubbles [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1274">1274</a><a name="r1274" id="r1274"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The surface tension tends to reduce the surface area, whereas  the surface charge tends to expand it. Equilibrium will be reached when these  opposing forces are equal, and this will occur when 50-micron-sized bubbles shrink to 100-200 nm-sized bubbles, concentrating any surface-bound ions. The expected increase in surface charge density with any reduction in bubble volume has been confirmed &nbsp;[<a href="ref21.html#r2068">2068</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Assume the  surface charge density on the inner surface of the bubble (radius r) is &Phi; (<a href="constants.html#C">C</a> &#739; m<sup>&minus;2</sup>).  The outwards pressure (P<sub>out</sub>, Pa) can be found  to give, where D is the relative dielectric  constant of the gas bubble (assumed unity),  &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> is the&nbsp; permittivity of a  vacuum (= 8.854 p<a href="constants.html#F">F</a> &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>). &nbsp;The inwards pressure (P<sub>in</sub>, Pa) due to  the surface tension on the gas is, where &gamma; is the surface  tension (0.07198 N   &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>, 25&nbsp;&deg;C). This equation is derived by considering the total surface charge (area &#739; charge density, 4&pi;r<sup>2</sup>&Phi;) as equivalently concentrated at the center of the spherical cavity. This charge then exerts a force on the same charge at the surface. The force would be (4&pi;r<sup>2</sup>&Phi;)<sup>2</sup>/4&pi;D&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup> from basic electrostatics (Coulomb's law), and therefore the pressure (force per unit area) would be (4&pi;r<sup>2</sup>&Phi;)<sup>2</sup>/(4&pi;D&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>r<sup>2</sup> &#739; 4&pi;r<sup>2</sup>) = &Phi;<sup>2</sup>/D&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>. However, for each part of the surface, the force has been double counted (towards the surface and towards the center; equivalent to the surface again). Therefore the pressure concerns only half this force,</p>

    <p>For nanobubble diameters of 10 nm, 20nm, 50 nm, 100 nm, and 200 nm, the calculated charge density for zero excess  internal pressure is  0.14, 0.10, 0.06, 0.04, and 0.03 e<sup>&minus;</sup> &#739; nm<sup>&minus;2</sup> bubble surface area respectively  (0.01 e<sup>&minus;</sup> &#739; nm<sup>&minus;2</sup> &equiv; - 1.6 -m<a href="constants.html#C">C</a> &#739; m<sup>&minus;2</sup>).<sup><a href="nanobubble.html#e">e</a></sup><a name="be" id="be"></a> 0.03  e<sup>&minus;</sup> &#739; nm<sup>&minus;2</sup> gives a zeta potential of -21 mV in 10 mM NaCl at 25&deg;C, <sup><a href="nanobubble.html#k"> k</a></sup><a name="bk" id="bk"></a> indicating that these charge densities are easily possible.</p>

    <p>Water droplets are easily charged [<a href="ref27.html#r2660">2660</a><a name="r2660" id="r2660"></a>], with surface charge giving rise to a significant   reduction in surface tension, see left, where the dashed red line extrapolates  the data. As the surface charge on the water is increased, its surface tension is reduced, indicating a decrease in surface water cohesion due to electrostatic repulsion. This reduction in the surface tension undoubtedly contributes to the stability of nanobubbles.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Such charge densities are achievable;  e.g., one surface anion to every about 250 surface water molecules would  stabilize a 100 nm diameter nanobubble. The nanobubble radius increases as the  total charge on the bubble increases to the power 2/3. Under these circumstances at  equilibrium, the water's &lsquo;effective&rsquo; surface tension  at the nanobubble  surface is zero, and the excess pressure is also zero. Charged gas in the bubble  increases  the size of stable nanobubbles. Further reduction in the bubble size would  not be indicated as it would cause the lowering of the internal pressure to  below atmospheric pressure and consequently cause inward gas flow into the bubble. An <a href="colligative_generation.html">interfacial osmotic pressure gradient</a> reduces the dissipation of the surface charge  when the bubbles shrink. This theory predicts that greater surface charge density allows decreased  nanobubble diameter, as found by some in dilute salt solutions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1771">1771</a><a name="r1771" id="r"></a>] but not by others [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2646">2646</a><a name="r2646" id="r2646"></a>]. However, nanobubble size also depends on the bulk properties, and increased pH leads to expanded nanobubble diameter and the increase in OH<sup>&minus;</sup> concentration [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r506">506</a>]. Amphiphiles affect the stability of nanobubbles, with this effect varying with pH and ionic strength [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1298">1298</a><a name="r1298" id="r1298"></a>] and increasing with the adsorption of chaotropic anions at the liquid-gas interface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2744">2744</a><a name="r2744" id="r2744"></a>]. There is a balance of competing charge interactions between <a href="water_dissociation.html">water dissociation</a> and <a href="interfacial_water.html">interfacial ion mobility</a>. Nanobubbles are reported to consequently undergo loss of charge at lower temperatures but charge conservation at higher temperatures    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref43.html#r4278">4278</a><a name="r4278" id="r4278"></a>]. This is reported as  giving rise to the dependency of bulk nanobubble size on temperature, with increasing temperature significantly narrowing the bubble-size distribution. Nanobubbles' mean radii have been shown to shrink reversibly to about 50 nm as temperatures rise to 45&nbsp;&deg;C, but with higher temperatures giving  slightly greater size.<br />

    <p><a name="divide" id="divide"></a>It is  possible that the bubble could divide to give smaller bubbles due to the  surface charge.&nbsp; Assuming that a bubble of  radius r and total charge q divides to give two bubbles of shared volume and  charge (radius r<sub>&frac12;</sub>= r/2<sup>1/3</sup>, charge q<sub>&frac12;</sub>=0.5q), and  ignoring the Coulomb interaction between the bubbles, calculation of the change  in energy due to surface tension (&Delta;E<sub>ST</sub>)  and surface charge (&Delta;E<sub>q</sub>)  gives,</p>

    <p align="left">For nanobubble diameters of 5 nm, 10 nm, 20 nm, 50 nm, and 100  nm, the calculated charge density for bubble splitting is 0.12, 0.08, 0.06, 0.04,  and 0.03 e<sup>&minus;</sup> nm<sup>&minus;2</sup> bubble surface area, respectively. For the  same surface charge density, the bubble diameter is always about three times  larger for reducing the apparent surface tension to zero than for splitting the  bubble in two. Thus, bubbles will never divide unless there is a further energy  input, such as  increased stirring. Further support towards the stabilization of bulk nanobubbles comes from 2020 theoretical work on the net charge of the bubble and its zeta potential  [<a href="ref41.html#r4015">4015</a><a name="r4015" id="r4015"></a>]. The primary consideration of this model was that the charge on the interface was conserved during shrinkage resulting in stabilization at about a typical radius of &sim;100 nm.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The presence of salt ions may adversely affect nanobubble stability, causing aggregation followed by coalescence at higher salt concentrations [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1435">1435</a><a name="r1435" id="r1435"></a>]. Other studies have found that 0.9% NaCl at 4&nbsp;&deg;C causes the nanobubbles to grow to 1000 nm - 2000 nm, where they are stable  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3415">3415</a><a name="r3415" id="r3415"></a>]. The aggregation behavior is like that of the salting-out of colloidal particles due to the screening of the particle charge by the ionic strength of the solution. Coalescence is due to changes at the gas-water interface. </p>

    <p><a name="zeta" id="zeta"></a> An additional stabilizing effect on the charged interface is the slow rate of gas diffusion towards the bulk liquid surface from surfaces and bulk-phase nanobubbles  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1973">1973</a><a name="r1973" id="r1973"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1987">1987</a><a name="r1987" id="r1987"></a>]. In particular, nanobubbles within a cluster of bulk nanobubbles protect each other from diffusive loss by a shielding effect  [<a href="ref21.html#r2074">2074</a><a name="r2074" id="r2074"></a>], effectively producing a back pressure of gas from neighboring bubbles  if separated by about the thickness of the unstirred layer.                 
      This slow dissolution will be even more gradual than might be expected due to the <a href="colligative_generation.html">higher osmotic pressure at the gas-liquid interface</a>, so both prevent the gas from dissolving and drive any dissolved gas near the interface back into the nanobubble  [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2057">2057</a><a name="r2057" id="r2057"></a>]. Also, supersaturation around the nanobubbles may lower the surface tension, so reducing the pressure [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2013">2013</a>] and required back-pressure. A further factor may be the thickening of the surface layer up to about 17% of the nanobubble gaseous diameter [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref44.html#r4387">4387</a><a name="r4387" id="r4387"></a>], as shown by solvent relaxation nuclear magnetic resonance, where its spin-spin relaxation time  is  two orders lower than that of the free water. This concept of a thick interfacial layer is  supported by the higher forces required to penetrate greater depths of surface nanobubbles  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1986">1986</a><a name="r1986" id="r1986"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1987">1987</a>]. There is also evidence of a novel structure of water within this interface  using  synchrotron-based scanning transmission soft X-ray microscopy (STXM)  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2347">2347</a><a name="r2347" id="r2347"></a>]. There is also evidence that the internal pressure of these nanobubbles may be up to 50x atmospheric pressure [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3904">3904</a><a name="r3904" id="r3904"></a>].</p>

    <p>A hydrophobic covering at the gas-liquid interface can stabilize nanobubbles  [<a  href="ref27.html#r2636" name="r2636" title="go to cited reference" id="r2636">2636</a>]. The physical theory behind this explanation holds for any covering with an affinity for the gas, including <a href="colligative_generation.html#nano">osmotic pressure generation</a>. Mousing over the figure (above left) shows the <a href="interfacial_water.html#b"> zeta potential</a> of the nanobubble. This zeta potential reduces in higher ionic strength solutions (with positive charges interfering), with lower pH (less OH<sup>&minus;</sup>), and with greater diameter bubbles (there is a thinner unstirred layer if the surface skin is more flexible).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Nanobubbles tend towards self-organization [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1269">1269</a>] in much the same way as charged oil-water emulsions, colloids [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1275">1275</a><a name="r1275" id="r1275"></a>] and nanoparticles.  This is due to a combination of their charge, long-range attraction [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1322">1322</a><a name="r1322" id="r1322"></a>], slow diffusion, and the presence of <a href="colligative_generation.html">interfacial osmotic pressure gradients</a>.  Bulk nanobubbles behave as rigid entities under compression but readily expand under tension   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2832">2832</a><a name="r2832" id="r2832"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Where there are many bulk phase nanobubbles, such as in electrolyzed aqueous solutions, there are relatively large amounts of water associated with the surfaces, which can give rise to greater hydration effects due to their higher capacity for forming new hydrogen bonds. Nanobubbles increase the mobility of the water molecules in the bulk, as shown by the increase in  proton NMR relaxation time <em>T<sub>2</sub></em> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2014">2014</a><a name="r2014" id="r2014"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Together with the mechanisms given above, It may be  that the inter-bubble distance  is an important factor in stabilizing  bulk nanobubbles, and it is likely to be in a close relationship with the bubble radius. This would connect the stabilized nanobbubble size with their concentrations [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3357">3357</a><a name="r3357" id="r3357"></a>]. </p>

    <p>The question arises as to why these surface charge effects are not seen to affect the surface tension under different conditions of pH and solute. The answer is partly that small nanobubbles are continually moving such that they lose counter-ions beyond their slip planes, and partly that the effect of the charged surface is stronger through the low-dielectric gas phase formed by the tightly curved surfaces.</p>

    <p> Under 260 nm excitation wavelength, nanobubbles seem to give two wide structure-less photoluminescence bands at 345 nm and at 425 nm  due to the electronic charge density induced by the concentration of hydrated ionic compounds at their interface [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r800">800b</a><a name="r800" id="r800"></a>].

    <p>Interestingly, bulk nanobubbles are subject to <a href="Brownian.html">Brownian motion</a>, so they behave as though they have solid shells like nanoparticles. Thus, (more  significant concentrations of) nanobubbles can be determined using <strong>dynamic light scattering (DLS)</strong> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2743">2743</a>] that uses the fluctuations in the scattering of laser light traveling through the sample solution (see right). These fluctuations are due to the <a href="Brownian.html#brownian">Brownian motion</a> of the particles with larger bubbles giving greater scattering but slower fluctuations. The calculated diffusion constants are used to determine the hydrodynamic sphere-equivalent  radius, r, of the particles  using the Stokes-Einstein equation, </p>

    <p><strong>Electrical sensing</strong> makes use of a  Coulter counter (see right). This  is usually used in microbiology to count cells and virus particles as they flow  through a narrow channel between two vessels, with each particle causing a  change in the electrical resistance between them.  The change in impedance is proportional to the volume of the particle traversing the   channel due to its displacement of   the liquid. In a similar way, such a device will also count and size  bubbles flowing through the channel.</p>

Water containing nanobubbles can be used in water treatment [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2308">2308</a><a name="r2308" id="r2308"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r3575">3575</a><a name="r3575" id="r3575"></a>] and as a surface cleaning material [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2305">2305</a><a name="r2305" id="r2305"></a>, <a  href="ref27.html#r2640" name="r2640" title="go to cited reference" id="r2640">2640</a>, <a  href="ref35.html#r3409" name="r3409" title="go to cited reference" id="r3409">3409</a>] (see right). It is used, for example, in bathrooms without the need for additives or detergents and with low water usage. They are also used in froth-flotation   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3169">3169</a><a name="r3169" id="r3169"></a>]. The use of <a href="o2water.html#ozone">ozone</a>, rather than air or oxygen, in the nanobubbles generates a more powerful cleaning action and disinfection of great use in  producing safe drinking water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref39.html#r3823">3823</a><a name="r3823" id="3823"></a>]. Due  to chain reactions involving hydroxyl radicals, its usefulness involves strong  oxidation capabilities, with no chemical residuals. The nanobubble carriers solutions have a longer lifespan than macro bubbles and are efficient at  ozone delivery.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Nanobubbles' large gas-liquid interfaces pick up insoluble, but surface-active, fragrance and flavor molecules into an aqueous solution for use in the food and fragrance industries [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2309">2309</a><a name="r2309" id="r309"></a>]. They also pick up nanoparticles from wastewater [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3178">3178</a>]. Also, nanobubble solutions can pick up nanoparticles [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2721">2721</a>b] by  new bubble nucleation and collision aiding a cleaning mechanism free from detergents or chemicals [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2746">2746</a><a name="r2746" id="r2"></a>]. The possible mechanisms for bubble-particle attachment have been described  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3028">3028</a><a name="r3028" id="r3028"></a>]. Nanobubbles  bind preferentially to small hydrophobic particles causing them to merge to form larger agglomerates due to the large capillary forces that develop    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3170">3170</a><a name="r3170" id="r3170"></a>]. The hydrophobic conglomerates are more stable than hydrophilic ones due to the large capillary forces that develop.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Nanobubbles may form fine particle aggregates that facilitate pick-up by larger bubbles [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3622">3622</a><a name="r3622" id="r3622"></a>]. A mixture of nanobubbles and microbubbles has been shown to clean the concentration polarization that builds up on reverse osmosis membranes and may be used in  cleaning-in-place (CIP) operations [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3010">3010</a><a name="r3010" id="r3010"></a>]. They also can be used to remove colloidal ferric hydroxide [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3180">3180</a><a name="r3180" id="r3180"></a>], float quartz particles [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3196">3196</a><a name="r3196" id="r3196"></a>], and interact with calcium carbonate and an alternating magnetic field to remove scale from cooling water pipes  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref41.html#r4061">4061</a><a name="r4061" id="r4061"></a>]. Combination of microbubbles and nanobubbles with ultrasonics  enhances their cleaning ability,  enabling cold water cleaning. This system (Ultrasonically Activated Stream, Ultrawave Ltd.) bases its cleaning action on the speed of the bubble wall motion, and not by the presence of high concentrations of metastable nanobubbles or (like pressure washers) on the  flow velocity [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2859">2859</a><a name="r2859" id="r2859"></a>]. Nanobubbles  degrade organic pollutants in wastewater treatment technologies [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2904">2904</a><a name="r2904" id="r2904"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2937">2937</a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3690">3690</a><a name="r3690" id="r3690"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Aqueous nanobubble solutions  produce submicromolar <a href="o2water.html">hydroxyl radicals </a>(&middot;OH) and superoxide ions (O<sub>2</sub>&middot;<sup>&minus;</sup> ) that can have biological effects [<a  href="ref27.html#r2637" name="r2637" title="go to cited reference" id="r2637">2637</a>],  including  promoting the growth of plants, fish, and mice [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2015">2015</a><a name="r2015" id="r2015"></a>] and as food disinfectants, decontamination, and pollutant degradation. Business is expected to increase to US$ 4.3 billion in 2020. Plasmonic nanobubbles show great promise in cancer treatment [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2310">2310</a><a name="r2310" id="r2310"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, a continuing and general lack of awareness concerning  the presence of nanobubbles in both ordinary and complex aqueous solutions has meant that many scientists remain ignorant of the effects that their presence and concentration may have on their studies.</p>

    <p align="left"><sup>a<a name="a" id="a"></a></sup> <font face="Arial">Bubble and particle flow and liquid molecular and turbulent motions are often described by  a few empirical relationships involving

      dependent on the configuration of the system, at which there is a transition
      from streamlined flow to turbulent flow. <i>Re</i> is defined as <strong>L<i>f</i><sub>m</sub>/</strong></font><strong><font face="Symbol">h</font></strong><font face="Arial"> or <strong>L<i>f</i>/<font face="Symbol">n</font></strong>, where L is the characteristic length of the system (m), <i>f</i><sub>m</sub> is the mass

Also, small gas-containing bubbles (4 - 20 &micro;m diameter, with &asymp; 500 nm thick skins) are produced in the air during electrolysis with inner and outer gas/liquid interfaces.
