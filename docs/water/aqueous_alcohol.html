    <p> Methanol, ethanol, and propanol are miscible with water in all proportions to form non-ideal solutions. When water is mixed with alcohol, hydrogen bonds can form between the alcohol molecules, between the water molecules and between water and the alcohol molecules. Whereas water can form four hydrogen bonds (two H-acceptors and two H-donors), alcohols can only form three (two H-acceptors and one H-donor). Some of the  H-acceptor sites in any aqueous-alcoholic mixture must be unfulfilled. In mixed hydrogen bonding, proton acceptor from the water (RHO&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;H-O-H) is more favorable than that of proton donor from the alcohol (RO-H&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;OH<sub>2</sub>). Low molecular weight alcohols form zigzag chains of molecules connected by single donor and acceptor hydrogen bonds (see above left) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref27.html#r2700">2700</a><a name="r2700" id="r2700"></a>]. Pure methanol forms hydrogen-bonded networks containing hexamers and octamers  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref43.html#r4273">4273</a><a name="r4273" id="r4273"></a>], and such clusters are expected in aqueous-alcoholic solutions.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Aqueous alcoholic solutions<sup><a href="aqueous_alcohol.html#e" name="be" id="be"> e</a></sup> have been reviewed [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2354">2354</a><a name="r2354" id="r2354"></a>]. Low relative molecular mass (molecular weight) alcohols freely mix with water and are 
      widely used as solvents and, in the case of ethanol, in alcoholic 
      drinks. Although mixing freely, the resulting liquid is not homogeneous but consists of water and alcoholic and mixed water/alcoholic clusters. Methanol and ethanol show negative excess entropies of mixing [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref28.html#r2718">2718</a><a name="r2718" id="r2718"></a>]. On adding the water, the  liquid microjet X-ray absorption spectra show significantly enhanced hydrogen-bonding of the methanol and ethanol hydroxyl groups  resulting in the reduction in entropy and negative enthalpy of mixing due to the more significant clustering. As we add ethanol to water, the water hydrogen bonds strengthen with the water forming stiff clathrate cages around the ethanol molecules. However, as the volume ratio increases beyond 20%, a phase transition occurs where  the water goes from its cage-like structure to forming hydrogen-bonded links between the ethanol molecules  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3033">3033</a><a name="r3033" id="r3033"></a>]. The competition between hydrophilic and   hydrophobic interactions in methanol/water mixtures is different between freezing and warm temperatures, with the physical properties also determined by the temperature   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3109">3109</a><a name="r3109" id="r3109"></a>].    In the supercooled regime,  the hydrogen-bonding interactions have a lifetime long enough to sustain a stable water network. However, increasing the temperature destroys these water clusters progressively. In addition, at temperatures higher than about 265 K, the hydrophobicity gradually increases to dominate the physical properties of the solutions   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3702">3702</a><a name="r3702" id="r3702"></a>]. Using molecular dynamics simulations and a core-softened potential approach, it has been shown that methanol can suppress  the liquid-liquid phase transition in water  [<a href="ref43.html#r4222">4222</a><a name="r4222" id="r4222"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Analysis of the clustering in ethanolic solutions depends slightly on the definition of the hydrogen bond used, with the looser definitions giving the least amount of free molecules [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3071">3071</a><a name="r3071" id="r3071"></a>]. The solutions are micro-heterogeneous, with 
      the alcohols tending to form linear but zigzagging, hydrogen-bonded chains 
      with each other (with increasing effect with the alcohol hydrophobicity). 
      At low alcohol contents, the water molecules form tetrahedral clusters [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r776">776</a><a name="r776" id="r776"></a>], <sup><a href="aqueous_alcohol.html#c" name="bc" id="bc"> c</a></sup> mostly excluding the alcohol molecules (although at higher temperatures, mixed clusters predominate [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1569">1569</a><a name="r1569" id="r1569"></a>]). Aliphatic alcohols create one strong  hydrogen bond to water, about 75% of the strength of a water-water hydrogen bond, but further hydrogen-bonding to the two further possible sites is much weaker [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2355">2355</a><a name="r2355" id="r2355"></a>]. There appear to be few  hydrophobic contacts within aqueous solutions of alcohols ranging from methanol to tertiary butyl alcohol, as the interactions between their small hydrophobic groups are weaker than any thermal energy fluctuations. These small hydrophobic groups are surrounded by relatively strong water clusters, removing the driving force for hydrophobic interactions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref25.html#r2432">2432</a><a name="r2432" id="r2432"></a>].<br />

    <p>Alcoholic solutions may contain several distinct liquid phases dependent on solutes, temperature, and pressure [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1297">1297</a><a name="r1297" id="r1297"></a>] with greater segregation at higher pressures  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref28.html#r2769">2769</a><a name="r2769" id="r2769"></a>] and, in the case of glycerol, at lower temperatures   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref28.html#r2770">2770</a><a name="r2770" id="r2770"></a>]. In contrast, simulations indicate that water molecules form long chains in freezing ethanolic solutions with lower segregation [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3087">3087</a><a name="r3087" id="r3087"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In line with their hydrophobic nature, the alcohols preferentially 
      occupy surface sites, up to maximum values equivalent to about 
      a mono-layer, and lower the surface tension [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r777">777</a><a name="r777" id="r777"></a>]. 
      At higher concentrations (molar alcohol:water &gt; 0.1), clear 
      micro-aggregation occurs [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r777">777</a>].  
      Binary mixtures of low molecular mass alcohols (e.g., ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol but not methanol [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref25.html#r2452">2452</a><a name="r2452" id="r2452"></a>]) show azeotropy<sup><a href="aqueous_alcohol.html#a" name="ba" id="ba"> a</a></sup> with water, caused by the changes of the evaporation properties of the solution with composition. The mole fraction of ethanol, 1-propanol, and 2-propanol in their azeotropic mixtures are 89%, 43%, and 68%, respectively. </p>
    <p>A comparison of the vibrational, reorientational, and hydrogen bond dynamics of ethanol in water and in hexane has been made [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4141">4141</a><a name="r4141" id="r4141"></a>]. Ethanol is fully miscible in both solvents and forms  micelle-like domains in water but cyclic clusters, resembling loops, in hexane.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The effect of increasing mole fraction is shown for 1-propanol (above left [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1746">1746</a><a name="r1746" id="r1746"></a>]). At low 1-propanol composition, hydrogen-bonded  water clustering excludes the alcohol so that the alcohol evaporates more readily. At high alcohol content, clustering of the alcohol molecules due to inter-alkyl van der Waals forces plus  hydrogen-bonding interactions exclude the water molecules such that the water evaporates preferentially   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1746">1746</a>]. Similarly, low methanol concentrations do not interfere with the water structuring, whereas  high methanol concentrations destroy the structure of water as they leave alcohol-water aggregates   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3119">3119</a><a name="r3119" id="r3119"></a>] and long-range correlations [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4312">4312</a><a name="r4312" id="r4312"></a>]. In aqueous methanol, ethanol, and 1-propanol solutions, the more hydrophobic methyl chains raise the intensity ratio of the 3430 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> sub-band to the 3220 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> peak, indicating that the single donor-acceptor water molecules form at the interface between these hydrophobic areas and water. Mixtures of water and ethanol exhibit  a steep increase  in the surface ethanol molecules up to a 0.1 mole fraction with increased ordering     [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref43.html#r4277">4277</a><a name="r4277" id="r4277"></a>].    </p>

    <p>The hydrogen-bonding strength may be assessed from the<em> v</em><sub>2</sub>+<em>v</em><sub>3</sub> overtone at about 5210 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2331">2331</a><a name="r2331" id="r2331"></a>]. High water content weakens the average strength of hydrogen bonding in the mixture as individual water&ndash;water interactions are then weaker than those between the alcohol and water    [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1746">1746</a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  <p>The partial molar volumes of water and the alcohols usually present a complex picture (see right) where the total volumes are reduced compared with the sum of the individual volumes. This complexity is due to the balance of the water-water and solute-water interactions [<a href="ref25.html#r2420">2420</a><a name="r2420" id="r2420"></a>], with the net loss of strong hydrogen-bonding. The speed of sound similarly varies with the mole fraction (see right), indicating a stiffening of the structure at low (&asymp; 0.1) mole fractions  [<a href="ref29.html#r2885">2885</a><a name="r2885" id="r2885"></a>], in line with the Raman results [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3033">3033</a>]. The self-diffusion of water in ethanol-water mixtures has been reported [<a  href="ref36.html#r3594" name="r3594" title="go to cited reference" id="r3594">3594</a>]. The thermal conductivity of ethanol-water solutions behaves similarly to the speed of sound but with a maximum at about 0.025-mole fraction of ethanol  [<a  href="ref41.html#r4079" name="r4079" title="go to cited reference" id="r4079">4079</a>]. In the very diluted region (x<sub>ethanol</sub>&lt; 0.025), water shows   greater tetrahedral order and stiffer hydrogen-bonding, whereas when 0.025 &lt; x<sub>ethanol</sub>&lt; 0.1, the hydration shells coalesce, and the alkyl chains begin to associate, promoting increasing hydrogen-bonding between water and the -OH group of the alcohol. Above 0.1 mole fraction, hydrogen-bonding between ethanol molecules increases, and the thermal conductivity reduces further. The interactions with methanol has also been noted [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4160">4160</a><a name="r4160" id="r4160"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> The  experimental Raman spectra and molecular dynamics <a href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html#e">tetrahedrality</a> of water molecules in the hydration shells of short-chain alcohols have been determined [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3404">3404</a><a name="r3404" id="r3404"></a>]. These undergo a crossover above 100&nbsp;&deg;C (at 30 MPa) to   less tetrahedral structures than pure water. </p>

      <p>The rotational and translational dynamics of  neutral (CO, NO) and charged (CN<sup>&minus;</sup>) diatomic species have been determined in simulations of water-ethanol mixtures [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref41.html#r4007">4007</a><a name="r4007" id="r4007"></a>]. The opposite behavior is found between the neutral and charged species. The self-diffusion constants of both CO and NO initially decrease and then increase with the increasing ethanol composition after attaining a minimum at 10%. However, CN<sup>&minus;</sup>'s self-diffusion  constant  has about the same value as these two in water but continuously reduces with increasing ethanol composition.      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Protonated alcohols present a much simpler structure to protonated water, as they consist of simple chains and rings with no three-dimensional aspects [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3223">3223</a><a name="r3223" id="r3223"></a>].</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Methanol/water dynamics have been investigated using  quasielastic neutron scattering employing an isotopic substitution [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r4407">4407</a><a name="r4407" id="r"></a>]. This  showed that nanoscopic association among unlike molecular species caused the  viscosity of the mixtures at intermediate concentrations to be higher than that  of the pure components. The structural details, viscosity trends, and dynamic phenomena in aqueous <em> t</em>-butanol solutions have been investigated using small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering (SWAXS) method and molecular dynamics  simulations [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref39.html#r3824">3824</a><a name="r3824" id="r3824"></a>]. Four composition ranges with qualitatively different structures and viscosity trends were revealed, involving five <em>t</em>-butanol -water hydrogen-bonding lifetimes. Both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic effects were found to be important in the formation of the <em>t</em>-butanol aggregates. A molecular dynamics study using graph theory has revealed that the alcohol aggregates in fully miscible aqueous methanol and ethanol  mix well with water and disrupt its  hydrogen-bond networks. In contrast, the networks of <em>n</em>-butanol aggregates do not mix well with water and little alter the remaining water structure  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4104">4104</a><a name="r4104" id="r4104"></a>]. This explains why <em>n</em>-butanol is not completely miscible in water, forming  two liquid phases between ~0.02 and 0.5 alcohol mole fractions. More hydrophobic alcohols, such as <em>t</em>-butanol, 2-butyl alcohol, and 2-butoxyethanol, behave similarly to methane in solution [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4107">4107</a><a name="r4107" id="r4107"></a>] and encourage clathrate structures formation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4108">4108</a><a name="r4108" id="r4108"></a>], although these are much more fluid than the solid hydrates. <sup><a href="aqueous_alcohol.html#f" name="bf" id="bf"> f</a></sup> At higher concentrations, these more hydrophobic alcohols tend to disrupt water structure and decrease the tetrahedrality of the local water.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The butanol isomers , <em>n</em>-butanol, sec-butanol (<em>s</em>-butanol), isobutanol (<em>i</em>-butanol) and tert-butanol (<em>t</em>-butanol) have distinct<br />
        liquid&ndash;liquid phase diagrams, with t-butanol fully miscible in water, whilst the otherss are only partially miscible under ambient<br />
      conditions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref43.html#r4298">4298</a><a name="r4298" id="r4298"></a>]. The small tert-butanol aggregates causes significant disruption of the water H-bond network, forming a homogeneous solution, whereas the other butanols form large aggregates excluding ther water.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Aqueous alcohols are part of many aqueous co-solvent  mixtures of small polar molecules such as amides, alcohols, dimethylsulfoxide, or ions in water that seem fully miscible  but are heterogeneous on the nanometer scale [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref41.html#r4074">4074</a><a name="r4074" id="r4074"></a>]. Hydrogen-bond networks are mostly preserved in the water-rich regions but are composition-dependent at lower water contents. The dynamics of the mixture span the timescales from picoseconds and nanoseconds, for hydrogen bonding timescales, to milliseconds and seconds for  bulk reorganization.      </p>

    <h2><a name="tears" id="tears"></a>Alcoholic tears</h2>
    <p> First described by Lord Kelvin's brother in 1855, <sup><a href="aqueous_alcohol.html#d" name="bd" id="bd"> d</a></sup> tears can be seen as a ring of clear liquid near the top of a glass of alcoholic drink, from which droplets continuously form and drop back into the beverage  (the Gibbs&ndash;Marangoni effect). It is most evident in strong wines and spirits. As the alcohol has a lower surface tension than water, a solution of increased alcohol content rises up the glass [<a href="ref31.html#r3042">3042</a><a name="r3042" id="r3042"></a>]. Preferential evaporation of the alcohol then increases the water content in this thin layer causing its surface tension to rise and for the liquid to drop back into the drink.</p>

    <p><a name="b" id="b"></a><sup>b</sup> The ABV (alcohol by volume) is expressed as&nbsp;a   percentage, often simply as % vol. It is defined as the number of milliliters (mL) of pure ethanol present in 100&nbsp;mL of solution at 20&nbsp;&deg;C (68&nbsp;&deg;F). It is <strong>not</strong> equal to the <a href="moles_molarity_molality.html#ww">% by volume (% v/v, or % volume fraction)</a>. For example, a 40 % ABV vodka contains 40 mL of ethanol in each 100 mL of vodka, but the vodka comprises more than 60 mL of water in every 100 mL of vodka. </p>

    <p><a name="e" id="e"></a><sup>e</sup> The British National Health Service had recommended that men and women should not regularly drink more than 3-4 units or 2-3 units of alcohol a day respectively. This recommendation has <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/545937/UK_CMOs__report.pdf" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"    target="otherWin9" onclick="newWin('otherWin9')">now been reduced to 14 units a week</a>, spread evenly over three or more days, for both men and women. One unit equals 10 mL (&asymp;  8 g) of pure ethanol, which is around&nbsp;the amount of alcohol the average adult can process in an hour. The units in any drink may be calculated by multiplying   the total volume of a drink (in mL)&nbsp;by its ABV (see b above) and dividing the result by 1,000; thus, a 'typical' bottle of wine (75 cL, 12 % vol ABV) contains 750 &#739; 12/1000 = 9 units which are more than twice that recommended for a couple in a day. 
      A pint of beer (ABV 4 %) contains 2.3 units (UK pint), 1.9  units (US pint). When trying to reduce the amount of alcohol  driunk, it is a good idea to have several alcohol-free days each week. When pregnant or trying to become pregnant, it is safest to avoid alcohol altogether. Drinking excessive alcohol  can affect the quality of  sperm.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Driving a car (or other vehicles) is significantly affected by drinking just one unit of alcohol. A person is probably legally drunk after drinking just five units of alcohol. Drunk-in-charge driving (driving under the influence of alcohol, DUI) is judged by the amount of alcohol in the blood (mg/100 mL) or breath (&micro;g/100 mL). The limits vary between different countries. [<a title="click for an explanation" href="aqueous_alcohol.html#be"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]    </p>
