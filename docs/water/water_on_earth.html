    <p>Water and ice have been central in shaping the surface of the Earth due to erosion from rivers and glaciers (see left for the glacier-eroded U-shaped valleys in the Lake District of the UK). As well as adding to the beauty of the countryside, this increases the area of fertile areas for agriculture.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Water dissolves well in the mantle rocks. It plays a crucial role in the mantle by reducing friction between moving rock and reducing the melting point of such rock, lowering its density, and reducing its viscosity,  encouraging the tectonic plates' movement , seismic activity (earthquakes), and volcanic activity. For example, at 1000 MPa and 1200&nbsp;&deg;C, the solubility of H<sub>2</sub>O in the basaltic melt is 206 &plusmn; 9 g &#739; kg<sup>&minus;1 </sup> [<a  href="ref31.html#r3097" name="r3097" title="go to cited reference" id="r3097">3097</a>]. The presence of <a href="ice_vii.html">ice VII</a> in diamonds points toward fluid-rich locations around the 660-kilometer upper boundary of the lower mantle (&asymp; 24 GPa)  [<a href="ref33.html#r3251" name="r3251" title="go to cited reference" id="r3251">3251</a>].</p>

    <p>The outer shell of the Earth (lithosphere) consists of separate and distinct extensive  rock layers (tectonic plates; see left), which float on the solid but fluid-like viscoelastic   layer beneath (asthenosphere). The relative fluidity of the asthenosphere allows the   tectonic plates to move (see red arrows left). The movement is caused by the upswelling of the asthenosphere, as particularly noticed in the mid-Atlantic ridge, a deep rift valley that spreads by about 2.5 cm per year. This motion is facilitated by water in and between the layers that reduce the friction. The water is drawn deep into the Earth (subduction) as one plate rides on top of another, taking many millennia to reappear in volcanic gases.</p>

    <p align="left">There has been much debate concerning global warming<sup><a href="water_on_earth.html#d">d</a><a name="bd" id="bd"></a></sup> over the last 50 years. Sometimes the science has been drowned out by the presence of many lay commentators, chosen  to 'balance' the arguments rather than for their scientific expertise. Because of this, there is a danger of opinion  rather than science unbalancing the debate. Modeling climate change is inexact, with many mostly understood, little understood, and unknown variables. There are complex multi-factorial inter-relationships that cause the predictions to be imprecise with wide uncertainty.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The  Earth's surface warms mainly due to the Sun's shorter wavelengths of visible radiation (see<a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#sunshine"> spectrum</a>). This radiation is absorbed, and some of the energy is radiated back outwards towards space as longer-wavelength infrared radiation. The atmosphere is mainly transparent to visible radiation but contains several molecular gases (H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>) that absorb infrared radiation.<sup><a href="water_on_earth.html#e">e</a><a name="be" id="be"></a></sup></p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">During Earth's existence, it has warmed and cooled many times due to natural events such as continental drift with the land occupation at the poles preventing warm water from the tropics melting and removing frozen water from these coldest regions of the world so allowing that to build up to cause glaciations  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref37.html#r3692">3692</a><a name="r3692" id="r3692"></a>]. Some of these temperature shifts have been quite extreme, such as the Snowball Earth (650 <a href="constants.html#mya" title="Mya (unit)">Mya</a>) when the Earth was almost  entirely frozen, through many ice age events to the last ice age (from 2.6 <a href="constants.html#mya" title="Mya (unit)">Mya</a> to about 0.024 <a href="constants.html#mya" title="Mya (unit)">Mya</a>). These have involved mass extinctions and the evolution of new species. Ten of the warmest years on record (since 1880) have come in the last twenty years, with five of the warmest in the last seven years (up to 2017). Cooling towards ice ages is slow as the ice  builds up only slowly, whereas warming can be much faster. The range over the last 800,000 years has been about 12&nbsp;&deg;C. The warming periods follow from increasing periods increasing CO<sub>2</sub>, giving a clear connection between these phenomena [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3126">3126</a><a name="r3126" id="r3126"></a>].</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> varies in the seasons (high in Winter, low in Summer (due to photosynthesis), and between high in the northern hemisphere  and low in the southern hemisphere (due to human activity and the size of the respective landmasses). There has been concern over  apparent rapid warming over the last century caused by man's industrial activity in burning fossil fuels (see the  rise in atmospheric <a href="water_on_earth.html#atmCO2">CO<sub>2</sub> above</a>). Fossil fuels are known to be a cause due to their higher isotopic <sup>12</sup>C content than  found in other CO<sub>2</sub> sources. From  <abbr title="National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory">NOAA</abbr>, dire predictions of a dangerously warm Earth have been made for future  decades. Other reports limit the warming to 1.5&nbsp;&deg;C from the mid-19th century to post 2015 warming, so long as present measures and pledges are honored [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3061">3061a</a><a name="r3061" id="r3061"></a>]. It is important to note that global warming was preceded by increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> at the end of the last Ice Age [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3126">3126</a>]. The warming caused by this increase in CO<sub>2</sub> has delayed the next ice age by about 100,000 years.</p>

    <p align="left">Additionally, reports of  a recent &ldquo;slowdown&rdquo; in the increase of global surface temperature (see right for the last 135 yr, and mouse over for the last 1500 yr) have been challenged [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3061">3061b</a>], leaving the field somewhat confused. The temperature increase is 0.85&nbsp;&deg;C since 1880, with about 20 cm rise in sea level and a 40% decline in sea ice.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">A poorly understood component of global warming is the terrestrial carbon cycle [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3061">3061f</a>]. This might accelerate slow climate change in the future due to human-driven land-use changes in Earth's forests [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3061">3061c</a>]. Aerosols, <sup><a href="water_on_earth.html#f">f</a><a name="bf" id="bf"></a></sup> produced with the warming CO<sub>2</sub> and that have an overall cooling effect by reflecting incoming sunlight, have helped to reduce, by over a third, the warming effect from the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. As CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are reduced, so will the cooling effect of air pollution [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3254">3254</a><a name="r3254" id="r3254"></a>]. Trees are essential   in the control of CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere. For each <a href="constants.html#ton">ton</a> of dry wood, 1.851 tons of CO<sub>2</sub> is removed from the atmosphere, being replaced by 1.393 tons of oxygen gas (973 m<sup>3</sup> of pure O<sub>2</sub>) and 0.541 tons of water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref39.html#r3842">3842</a><a name="r3842" id="r3842"></a>].

title="Met Office cloud spotting guide; from https://public.wmo.int/en/WorldMetDay2017/classifying-clouds" width="320" height="674"  class="floatright" />Water is the most important absorber of the sunlight in the atmosphere (see <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#sunshine">elsewhere</a>). In particular, it is a strong absorber of the infrared radiation from the Sun-warmed Earth before it radiates back into space. As warm air holds much more water than cold air (see left), an increase in the atmosphere's  temperature causes an increase in Earth's blanket of water vapor and a further warming effect. The 13 <a href="constants.html#trillion">trillion</a> tons of water in the atmosphere (&asymp; 0.33% 
      by weight; compare to <a href="water_on_earth.html#atmco2" title="go for details of increasing CO2">CO<sub>2</sub> &asymp; 0.04%</a> by weight) is responsible for about 70% of all atmospheric 
      absorption of radiation. This is mainly in the infrared region, where 
      water shows its strongest absorption. It contributes 50 % to 60 %   
      to the Greenhouse effect; more than twice that due to animal and anthropogenically associated carbon dioxide, ensuring a warm habitable planet. Water operates  a negative feedback effect, due to the cloud formation that reflects the sunlight away (see <a href="http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/globalmaps/data/mov/MODAL2_M_CLD_FR.mov"  title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin5" onclick="newWin('otherWin5')">Quicktime movie</a>) and the oceanic export of latent heat 
      to attenuate global warming. Also, atmospheric water reduces the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) from hotter surface temperatures such that the OLR is an essentially linear function of surface temperature over a wide range of temperatures, rather than obeying the Stefan-Boltzmann law (black-body radiation proportional to the fourth power of the surface temperature) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3441">3441</a><a name="r3441" id="r3441"></a>]. Rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> is accompanied by an increasing atmospheric <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#l">humidity</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3061">3061e</a>] due to (1) a positive feedback effect, (2) warmer air absorbing more water, and (c) man's activities. <sup><a href="water_on_earth.html#c">c</a><a name="bc" id="bc"></a></sup> Note that, without this Greenhouse effect, the average temperature on Earth would be  well  below  the freezing point, and the Earth would be in a permanent ice age. Although water vapor absorbs more radiated heat than  CO<sub>2</sub>, the amount of H<sub>2</sub>O in the atmosphere is stabilized by its loss by increased rainfall.  No such mechanism exists for CO<sub>2</sub> which  may build up in the atmosphere and have a more  significant  influence on global warming.</p>

C<span id="description-text">louds  reflect sunlight away from the Earth, trapping the heat that   radiates from the Earth's surface, and re-emitting absorbed heat, resulting in a complex and somewhat uncertain relationship between global temperature and cloud cover. </span>The water content of the atmosphere varies about 100-fold between the hot and humid tropics and the cold and dry polar ice deserts (see above right and <a href="http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/globalmaps/data/mov/MYDAL2_M_SKY_WV.mov"  title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin6" onclick="newWin('otherWin6')">Quicktime movie</a>). Clouds typically contain liquid water aerosol droplets of 10 &micro;m - 15 &micro;m in  diameter but ranging between 1 &micro;m - 100 &micro;m in  diameter, with them well-spaced (~1 mm apart) at ~10<sup>8</sup> m<sup>-3</sup>, and typically about 100x smaller than raindrops. They  have a complex and controversial relationship in global warming as increased  cloud cover insulates the planet, contributing to global warming by preventing  heat loss. It also reflects sunlight into space, so cooling the planet, with  relative effects dependent upon the type and height of the clouds.  If increasing water vapor leads to warmer temperatures,  more   water vapor will be incorporated into the atmosphere and warming, and water absorption   will increase in a spiraling cycle. By contrast, if increased cloud cover leads to cooling, then the system will be stabilized. Changes in other gases, such as CO<sub>2</sub> will feed into these effects [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2222">2222</a>]. On balance, it appears that increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, is feeding into a <a href="http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_ALL_FINAL.pdf"  title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin25" onclick="newWin('otherWin25')">global warming</a> spike in an otherwise cooling Earth.</p>

Cloud condensation nuclei (aerosol particles, cloud seeds; such as sea salt, carbon black, and 'dust') are   particles with a dry diameter larger than 70 nm,   forming cloud droplets at 0.22 % supersaturation.

    <p align="left">Polar ice affects our climate as its white surface has a high albedo (reflectance) of up to about twelve times that of the open ocean. Any reductions in sea ice or the darkening of the ice caps due to lack of fresh snow exerts positive feedbacks in global warming. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The pattern of warming is very different at the North and South Poles (see <a href="water_on_earth.html#glob">above</a>), with the Arctic losing ice, on average if not consistently, and the Antarctic gaining ice. The rate of warming in the Arctic is near twice the global average, but it is used by the media as though it is typical of global warming. It has been proposed that this difference between the poles is due to the  ocean flow [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3024">3024</a><a name="r3024" id="r3024"></a>].  Warmer water, caused by global warming, flows to the Arctic and causes a reduction in surface sea ice. However, the northward flow of this warmer water is balanced by the deep  Northern Ocean's water returning south to well up in the Southern Ocean. Here, before being  warmed at the surface, it is drawn northwards to be replaced by   the deep, cold water.  Thus, global warming causes the oceans to increase the warming of the Arctic, whereas they reduce noticeable warming around Antarctica. It is no surprise that the Southern Ocean has shown little warming over recent decades, although warming may emerge in later decades as the deep Northern oceans are warmed. Note the patch of cold water in the North Atlantic  (see <a href="water_on_earth.html#glob">above</a>) due to buoyant salt-free water from the melting Greenland ice cap.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The mean sea level has risen &asymp; 120 m since the last ice age (&asymp; 20,000 years ago, a melt of &asymp; 5     &#739;10<sup>7</sup> km<sup>3</sup> of land-based ice) and, without man's interference, would have likely continued to rise slowly (&asymp; 0.4    mm    &#739; yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>) towards that of the last interglacial period (+6 - +9 m, 130,000 to 115,000 years ago). Recently, the masses of both the Greenland ice sheet and the Antarctic ice sheet have rapidly and increasingly declined due to surface melting and iceberg calving.  Between 2002 and 2016, Greenland and Antarctica shed approximately 305 km<sup>3</sup> and 136 km<sup>3</sup> of ice per year, respectively. This has caused the global sea-level to rise by 0.8   mm    &#739; yr<sup>&minus;1</sup> and 0.35 mm    &#739; yr<sup>&minus;1</sup>, respectively [<a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30879" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"  target="otherWin2" onclick="newWin('otherWin2')">NASA</a>]. These contribute to the estimated current long-term sea level rise of 3.4 mm    &#739; yr<sup>&minus;1</sup> from satellite data  [<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/sea-level/" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"  target="otherWin2" onclick="newWin('otherWin2')">NASA</a>], with the 2010-2020 rate of 4.8  mm    &#739; yr<sup>&minus;1</sup> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4163">4163</a><a name="r41634163" id="r"></a>]. Much of the difference is due to other melting land ice plus a smaller contribution from the expansion of water due to temperature rise. The high specific heat of water slows both the current global warming process and any future if now thought improbable, cooling recovery after greenhouse gas emissions are curtailed. It is expected that the oceans may rise by at least 28  centimeters by 2100. It should be noted that current land level rises and falls may be equal to the sea-level changes in some places; for example, Scotland has a rising landmass of about 3 mm     &#739; yr<sup>&minus;1</sup> due to rebound from the loss of ice sheets present during the last ice age.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The decline in the dissolved oxygen concentration in the oceans and coastal waters is partly due to global warming and  other human activities modifying nutrients and aquatic species [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3146">3146</a><a name="r3146" id="r3146"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A further point of dispute concerns the shape of the Earth. Higher gravity at the poles attracts the water from &nbsp;tropical areas with lower gravity such that any rise in the oceans would not necessarily be evenly distributed   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3212">3212</a><a name="r3212" id="r3212"></a>]. There would also be polar uplift due to the loss of land-based ice.</p>

    <p align="right">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The rates of evaporation of both water droplets and ice crystals are limited by the diffusive transport of the vapor. Therefore, the evaporation from ice and snow (sublimation) is  similar to that of water drops  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3446">3446</a><a name="r3446" id="r3446"></a>]. The rate of ice crystal sublimation [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4111">4111</a><a name="r4111" id="r4111"></a>] is particularly important as it has a major impact on global climate since surface ice and snow determine Earth&rsquo;s albedo.</p>

    <p>The <a href="thermodynamic_anomalies.html#Cp">high  specific heat</a> of water allows Earth's climate to be even-tempered, with an annual turnover of  huge amounts of water in the water cycle (see right). An outline of the water cycle on Earth is thought to have been first recognized and observed by Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref25.html#r2494">2494</a><a name="r2494" id="r2494"></a>]. Now, it can be partially represented by the diagram right [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2357">2357</a><a name="r2357" id="r2357"></a>]. Water has a lifetime in the atmosphere of about a week, on average, before precipitation. 20% of this precipitation over land evaporates before it reaches the ground. Of the remaining 80%, about a fifth is run-off into the river system. Most of the remainder goes into the soil and vegetation, and 3/4 of this is returned to the atmosphere by transpiration with the remainder seeping to the river system or evaporating from the soil. The daily flux of <a href="https://earth.gsfc.nasa.gov/hydro" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin1" onclick="newWin('otherWin1')">water through the atmosphere </a>is about 1260 km<sup>3</sup>. Transpiration  is the primary route for returning water to the atmosphere over land, with  plants releasing about 300 molecules for every CO<sub>2</sub> molecule captured during photosynthesis   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2357">2357</a>].</p>

    <p>Only 2.5% of the water on Earth is freshwater (&lt; &asymp; 0.5 g &#739; kg<sup>&minus;1</sup> salt in widely varying proportions; freshwater is not necessarily potable water).  Most of that fresh water is frozen  in the ice caps of Antarctica, Greenland, and Svalbard. Most of the remainder is inaccessible.&nbsp;Less than 0.9 % of the world's freshwater is in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, and accessible underground sources  (&asymp; 9.3 &#739; 10<sup>4</sup> km<sup>3</sup>) that can be used for drinking, cooking, hygiene, industry, and agriculture. By  2030, the world&rsquo;s population will consume over 6% of this water per year, with billions living under severe water stress. Presently, over half the world's population has access to piped water on premises, but about 10%  still have to use surface water and other poor, potentially unsafe, sources. Although small as a percentage, this 10% represents over 700,000,000 people. The map below shows the scarcity of blue water (fresh surface water and groundwater)  throughout the world [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2603">2603</a><a name="r2603" id="r2603"></a>]. 2021, in particular, has seen droughts over large areas of the Earth worsening with climate change [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4307">4307</a><a name="r4307" id="r4307"></a>].</p>

    <p>There have been significant recent improvements in India and China.

In western cities, we are wasteful in our water usage, using 6-10 times these necessary amounts, whereas in rural third-world countries, they get by on 10 L or less per day. The global domestic average is 184 L &#739; day<sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; person<sup>&minus;1</sup> (455 km<sup>3</sup> &#739; year<sup>&minus;1</sup>), and the global industry average is 300  L &#739; day<sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; person<sup>&minus;1</sup> (739 km<sup>3</sup> &#739; year<sup>&minus;1</sup> ) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2570">2570</a><a name="r2570" id="r2570"></a>].

As water supplies become more expensive and subject to greater demand, ways are continually being sought to reduce these industrial water usage figures.
