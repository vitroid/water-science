    <h2><a name="surf" id="surf"></a>The surface of liquid water</h2>
    <p>The air-water surface <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="interfacial_water.html#k"> e</a><a name="bk" id="bk"></a></sup> is a very complex system  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2629" name="r2629" id="r2629">2629</a>] and certainly not as simple as often assumed. The surfaces are also extensive with 3.6 &#739; 10<sup>8</sup> km<sup>2</sup> ocean's surface, 10<sup>13</sup> km<sup>2</sup> cloud and aerosol droplet surface and, ~150 m<sup>2</sup> per human lung surface area [<a  href="ref36.html#r3513" name="r3513" title="go to cited reference" id="r3513">3513</a>]. Even as we struggle  over the  best description for the bulk structuring of water and the water&rsquo;s interactions with  ions and other solutes, the surface of the water is even more challenging   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3216" name="r3216" id="r3216">3216</a>]. Nuclear quantum effects of surface water have been reviewed   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3138">3138</a><a name="r3138" id="r3138"></a>]. Surface water structure  varies with temperature, gas molecules binding, ions binding or excluded,  electrical gradients forming, and  its dielectric and chemistry  changes with apparent unpredictability. Further, both sides of the interface have &micro;m thick unstirred layers different from the bulk (gas or liquid) phases. Most  surface possesses a two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3230">3230</a><a name="r3230" id="r3230"></a>], which is clearly different from the bulk-phase three-dimensional network. Further, any surface evaporation causes the formation of helical macrostructures in the surface-water layer (&asymp; 1 mm)  [<a  href="ref32.html#r3194" name="r3194" title="go to cited reference" id="r3194">3194</a>]. It is quite possible that the evaporation processes involve clusters of water molecules (i.e., fog) being removed involving light absorption [<a  href="ref45.html#r4479" name="r4479" title="go to cited reference" id="r4479">4479</a>].<br />    
      &nbsp;<br />
      How far do the gas and liquid surfaces extend? Indeed, the volume of liquid water  considered &lsquo;surface&rsquo; should be electrically neutral, and this is one definition for the surface thickness for water. The interface must include the outer  monolayer, the boundary that gives rise to any <a href="interfacial_water.html#b">zeta potentia</a>l, and any double layer  of ions, plus deeper layers where there is surface-influenced anisotropy in  either charge or structure. The depth of this surface remains undetermined, but it  is likely to be somewhat greater than given by most techniques that look only  at a restricted range of selected properties. There is much direct evidence for an effective depth of the liquid surface measured in many nanometers [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2751" name="r2751" id="r2751">2751</a>]. Clearly, such a definition of  surface depth cannot encompass a charged surface. Therefore, any charge seen on the  surface may depend upon the surface layer thickness under consideration. It may  well vary between methodologies with different probe depths. &nbsp;Also confusing  is that the surface  is rough (with &asymp; 15% increased surface area   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2697" name="r2697" id="r2697">2697</a>] ) rather than planar  and is in constant flux rather than thermodynamically static. In a difference to hydrophobic solid/water interfaces, the gas/water surface is not flat, even in the most still conditions. It has  nanoscopic surface   waves (&asymp;  <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>, [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2697">2697</a>] ) existing on the water that scatter light with low intensity [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2407">2407</a><a name="r2407" id="r2407"></a>]. However, energetic considerations indicate   that these surface capillary waves are unlikely to be more than about  a water diameter high due to water&rsquo;s high surface tension. In addition to this,  several million monolayers exchange with the gas phase every second  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2408">2408</a><a name="r2408" id="r2408"></a>] and cause evaporation-dependent temperature gradients [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2714">2714</a><a name="r2714" id="r2714"></a>], so giving rise  to long-lasting surface discontinuities and nonequilibrium [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2409">2409</a><a name="r2409" id="r2409"></a>].</p>

    <p>The density, dielectric permittivity [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref8.html#r738">738</a><a name="r738" id="r738"></a>], and dipole moment of interfacial water change from their  bulk water values to those of the gas (five orders of magnitude) over a distance generally regarded as  less than about a nanometer. Thus, water&rsquo;s solvation and ionization properties  change at the interface. Most  ions and hydrophilic solutes are generally less evident at the interface, but  nonpolar gases are more soluble there  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1259">1259</a><a name="r1259" id="r1259"></a>]. Ions, including hydrogen and hydroxide ions, and other solutes  behave differently at the surface to their behavior in the bulk. A critical property of the surface concerns how it affects the local ion distribution.  Some ions, such as thiocyanate (SCN<sup>&minus;</sup> ), azide (N<sub>3</sub>
    <sup>&minus;</sup>), and iodide (I<sup>&minus;</sup>)  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref28.html#r2778">2778</a><a name="r2778" id="r2778"></a>], prefer the surface, whereas others avoid it, as shown by their effects  on the surface tension  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r674">674</a><a name="r674" id="r674"></a>] and bubble coalescence [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r672">672</a><a name="r672" id="r672"></a>]. Water at the solid-liquid interface exhibits an anomalously high ionic conductivity up to five orders of magnitude higher than  bulk water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref41.html#r4098">4098</a><a name="r4098" id="r4098"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Interfacial  water molecules at the gas-liquid surface strongly attract the bulk liquid,  causing a <a  title="go for more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#ST">high surface tension</a>. Liquid water at liquid-solid and liquid-gas interfaces behaves as a separate thermodynamic system from bulk water  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2263">2263</a><a name="r2263" id="r2263"></a>]. Liquid water at interfaces can be investigated using x-ray reflectivity [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2266">2266</a><a name="r2266" id="r2266"></a>], vibrational sum-frequency generation spectroscopy (<a href="water_methods.html#sfg">VSFG</a>) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1468">1468</a><a name="r1468" id="r1468"></a>,  <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref37.html#r3669">3669</a>]<a name="r3669" id="r3669"></a> and atomic force microscopy [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref8.html#r738">738</a>]. Heterodyne-detected sum-frequency generation spectroscopy of the water surface shows a combination mode (3640 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) of the hydrogen-bonded O-H stretch (~3450 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) and a low-frequency intermolecular vibration (~200 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>). This combination band is due to an anharmonic vibrational coupling  exclusively at the topmost surface  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref37.html#r3647">3647</a><a name="r3647" id="r3647"></a>]. Molecular dynamics simulations show, however, that the interface contains a significant amount (&gt;10%) of labile water (with weak O-H hydrogen bonds) that are not easily detectable by the conventional vibrational sum-frequency generation methodology [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref37.html#r3668">3668</a>]<a name="r3668" id="r3668"></a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Gas at air-water and other gas-water interfaces behaves like a flat <a  title="go for more information"  href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">hydrophobic surface </a><a title="click for an explanation" href="interfacial_water.html#g"><sup>b</sup></a><a name="bg" id="bg"></a>. The difference is that the van der  Waals interactions between the liquid and  gas surfaces are negligible.  The surface will be strongly attracted to probes approaching from the gas side at distances of about a micrometer and jumping into contact when still over 100 nm distant [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1294">1294</a><a name="r1294" id="r1294"></a>], thus showing the long-range nature of the attractive <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> forces. Interfacial water absorbs light differently to bulk water, with both absorptions at 270 nm [<a  href="ref14.html#r1328" name="r1328" title="go to cited reference" id="r1328">1328</a>] and   670 nm [<a  href="ref24.html#r2377" name="r2377" title="go to cited reference" id="r2377">2377</a>] being described. The structure of the surface is <a href="interfacial_water.html#j">not entirely understood,</a> but some information has been determined. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The  under-coordinated water molecules at the surfaces of both ice and water form similar ice-like, low-density phases that are hydrophobic, stiffer, superfluidic and thermally more stable than the bulk water  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2004">2004</a><a name="r2004" id="r2004"></a>]. Under pressure at hydrophobic surfaces, liquid water  shows increasing ice-like order. However, the pressure response  is opposite to that of hexagonal bulk ice, indicating that ice-like order is not to be confused with the presence of natural ice  [<a href="ref34.html#r3399" name="r3399" title="go to cited reference" id="r3399">3399</a>]. Hydrogen-bonding in the surface is stronger than in the bulk [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1261">1261</a><a name="r1261" id="r1261"></a>] (and this <a href="colligative_generation.html"   title="go for more information">affects  the osmotic pressure</a>). However, some hydrogen-bonding is lost, giving a more reactive environment [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r594">594</a><a name="r594" id="r594"></a>] and greater ice nucleation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref10.html#r914">914</a><a name="r914" id="r914"></a>]. The increased strength of surface water hydrogen bonds is partially due       to the reduced competition from neighboring water molecules [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2030">2030</a><a name="r2030" id="r2030"></a>] but has little effect on their vibrational lifetime [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1262">1262</a><a name="r1262" id="r1262"></a>]. This stronger bonding is due to <a title="go for more information"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">lower anti-cooperativity</a> and compensation for the increased chemical potential on the loss of some bonding. This surface hydrogen bonding gives rise to long-range specific ion effects on the aerial surfaces where tiny amounts of<abbrev> </abbrev><a href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">dodecahedral cluster</a>-stabilizing ions (such as <a href="ion_hydration.html#clo4">ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup></a>) affect the water clustering around distant but similar ions (such as I<sup>&minus;</sup>)  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2139">2139</a><a name="r2139" id="r2139"></a>]. The       diffusion within the surface is increased for some surface molecules  but decreased for       others and depends on the number of hydrogen bonds and the size of the water       clusters [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1263">1263</a><a name="r1263" id="r1263"></a>]. The       O&middot;&middot;&middot;O distance, between surface water molecules, within 2-3 nm from the 
    surface, expands by 5.9 % at 25&nbsp;&deg;C. Analysis of simple <a href="interfacial_water.html#c">thermodynamics</a> shows the surface probably has considerable structuring, having  identical density to  bulk water at just under 4&nbsp;&deg;C. In addition, the surface water structuring varies less with temperature than the bulk. Refractive index study of the water-air surface reveals it to be about 1.7 nm thick at 22&nbsp;&deg;C and denser than the bulk liquid (that is, it behaves like water at a lower temperature) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1482">1482</a><a name="r1482" id="r1482"></a>].

The  'dangling' O-H group is energetically isolated from the other vibrational modes of the surface water molecules, with its vibrational relaxation  proceeding with the rotation of the interfacial water molecules and not through the intramolecular energy transfer [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref44.html#r4317">4317</a><a name="r4317" id="r4317"></a>].</p>

    <p><a href="water_methods.html#sfg" title="click for an explanation">Sum-frequency  vibrational spectroscopy</a> (SFVS) shows that water's libration  frequency at the air/water interface is  834 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>, compared with the bulk value of &asymp; 670 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>. In contrast, the OH stretch, time-averaged structure, and ps structural dynamics   all show no change [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref28.html#r2785">2785</a><a name="r2785" id="r2785"></a>]. This indicates that although there is little change in water's hydrogen-bonding length at the interface, these hydrogen bonds are stiffer in their rotation, as happens at other hydrophobic surfaces. SFVS also shows that the <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#DDAA">doubly donor-acceptor and singly donor-acceptor water molecules</a> are the main hydrogen-bonded species in bulk water, with singly donor-acceptor water molecules the primary species at the air/water interface    [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref29.html#r2894">2894</a><a name="r2894" id="r2894"></a>]. The bending mode signal (~1650 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) is dominated by the surface water molecules at the interface and shows  the interfacial organization of water  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3789">3789</a><a name="r3789" id="r3789"></a>]. It acts as a reporter for the hydrogen-bond strengths of these water molecules. The bending mode frequency at the water/air interface indicates the stronger hydrogen bond of a DD-type (donor-donor) water than that of the D-type water molecule with a free O-H group.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The       density, dielectric (permittivity, [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref8.html#r738">738b</a>]), and dipole moment of interfacial water change from their       bulk water values to that of the gas over a <a href="interfacial_water.html#slip">distance of less than about a       nanometer</a>. Thus water&rsquo;s solvation and dissociation properties also change at the interface,       with ions and hydrophilic solutes generally being less soluble but       nonpolar gases more soluble [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1259">1259</a>].        Ions,       including hydrogen and hydroxide ions, and other solutes will behave       differently at the surface than  in the bulk.  Perhaps the most important property of the surface, after the surface tension, concerns how it affects the local ion distribution. Some ions prefer the surface, as shown by their effect on the  surface tension  (<a  title="go for more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#JR">Jones-Ray  effect</a>) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref7.html#r674">674</a>] and <a  title="go for more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#foam">bubble coalescence</a>.  Both OH<sup>&minus;</sup> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref11.html#r1025">1025</a><a name="r1025" id="r1025"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1266">1266</a><a name="r1266" id="r1266"></a>] and H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1308">1308</a><a name="r1308" id="r1308"></a>] can sit at gas/water interfaces, although clearly  not at the same time due to their rapid recombination to form H<sub>2</sub>O within this lower dielectric interface. As OH<sup>&minus;</sup> ions are       preferred over H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ions (<a href="interfacial_water.html#f">above about pH 3-4</a>), this generally reinforces the interface's  negative charge         compared with the bulk. Also, any carbon dioxide present forms carbonate and bicarbonate ions with  an affinity for aqueous/ hydrophobic surfaces endowing  further negative charges  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3209">3209</a><a name="r3209" id="r3209"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3304">3304</a><a name="r3304" id="r3304"></a>]. It should be noted, however, that no evidence of OH<sup>&minus;</sup> ions has been found at hydrophobic nanodroplet/water interfaces by sum frequency spectroscopy [<a href="ref29.html#r2811">2811</a>]. Indeed, the surface pH may be several pH units different from the bulk pH  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3405">3405</a><a name="r3405" id="r3405"></a>]. Strong acids like HCl and particularly HNO<sub>3</sub> re-associate at the interface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2190">2190</a><a name="r2190" id="r2190"></a>],  allowing their evaporation. However, weak acids, such as formic and acetic acids, have a strong surface preference but dissociate more rapidly when at the surface,  reducing evaporation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2787">2787</a><a name="r2787" id="r2787"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, although vibrational sum-frequency generation experiments concluded that both carbonate and bicarbonate anions are largely excluded from the air/water interface, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy suggests  a significant accumulation of carbonate below the depletion region outside of the area probed by sum-frequency generation [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3304">3304</a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>An experimental study with foam films of pure water showed stable films with  an equilibrium thickness of about 200 nm [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3915">3915</a><a name="r3915" id="r3915"></a>]. An equation describing the distribution of the electric potential (a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation) was derived, taking into account of the interaction between ions and the surface. From the concentration dependence of the surface density, it was concluded that  OH<sup>&minus;</sup> ions, and Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> ions, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup> ions adsorb specifically at the water/air interface. Both uncharged ammonia and small carboxylic acids may accumulate at the surface before their evaporation into the gas phase  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3615">3615</a><a name="r3615" id="r3615"></a>]. Thus the surface is more complex than that suggested by vibrational sum-frequency generation (see <a href="colligative_generation.html#nano">elsewhere for a hypothesis</a>). </p>

The shimmering buzz of partially charged water molecules at the surface (due to the predominance there of water molecules possessing only three hydrogen bonds) also contribute to the negative surface charge [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref45.html#r4456">4456</a><a name="r4456" id="r4456"></a>].</p>

    <p> A combination of kosmotropic/kosmotropic (e.g., LiCl) or chaotropic/ chaotropic (e.g., CsI) ions leads to the formation of ion-pairs at the liquid-air interface. In contrast, there appears to be no, or only small amounts of, such contact ion-pairs in the bulk water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2416">2416</a><a name="r2416" id="r2416"></a>]. Li<sup>+</sup> behaves differently from other Group I cations  (e.g.,  K<sup>+</sup>) in that it Li<sup>+</sup> adsorbs to the aqueous solution-vapor interface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3081">3081</a><a name="r3081" id="r3081"></a>].  This is thought due to the Li<sup>+</sup> ion holding onto its entire hydration shell even in the topmost layer of the solution.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Small cations (<a title="go for more information" href="kosmotropes_chaotropes.html">kosmotropes</a>, but see <a title="go for more information" href="physical_anomalies.html#foam">ion effects in foams</a>) are found away from the interface towards the bulk where their requirement for efficient hydration may be satisfied and as they cannot easily be stripped of the bound water by the interface. Also, a very large  electrostatic solvation free energy cost  prevents adsorption of low polarizability ions at hydrophobic interfaces such as oils or air  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2117">2117</a><a name="r2117" id="r2117"></a>].

Small gas molecules bind to these surface clusters due to  multiple van der Waals dispersion interactions plus the good fit between the gas molecules and the clusters. In particular, the clusters shown right are particularly stable and may form molecule-holding sites. There is no possibly negative influence caused by the necessary closure of the clusters within the bulk. This explains  the greater <a title="go for more information" href="material_anomalies.html#min">solubility of the hydrophobic gases</a> at the interface as they can  occupy clathrate-type water dodecahedra and <a href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#pancake">pancake-like structures</a>.

This high-density liquid layer was  separated from bulk water by a clear interface, indicating the presence of  two kinds of immiscible structured water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4175">4175</a><a name="r4175" id="r4175"></a>].</p>

    <p>Very high mobilities of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&minus;</sup> ions have been observed at the water-vapor interface under static electric field orientations of &minus;45&deg; and +45&deg; (relative to the surface plane)  and 0.05 V &#739; &Aring;<sup>&minus;1</sup>. These field orientations are  able to pin charges to the vapor interface in addition to dragging them along it  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4171">4171</a><a name="r4171" id="r4171"></a>].</p>

    <p>It has been discovered that the charge on the interface affects the freezing point of supercooled water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1737">1737</a><a name="r1737" id="r1737"></a>]. On a surface with no electric field, water droplets were found to freeze at around -12.5&nbsp;&deg;C. On a positively charged surface, however, the freezing point   is raised to -7&nbsp;&deg;C, while if the surface is negatively charged, the   droplet does not freeze until the temperature reaches -18&nbsp;&deg;C. Whether this strange behavior is due to the reversal of the charge of the natural negatively-charged surface destroying the water clustering has yet to be determined. </p>

    <p>The wetting properties of a solid surface depend on the surface topology and are characterized by the length of the surface charge dipoles   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r39173917">3917</a><a name="r3917" id="r3917"></a>]. There is a critical length of these charge dipoles, below which they have a negligible effect on wetting. This results from the collective interactions, where the steric exclusion effect between water molecules prevents the water hydrogen atoms from staying close to the negative charges at the same time as the  water oxygen atoms stay  close to the positive charges. The  interface  between water  and a textured hydrophobic surface can  exist in  two regimes; either  the <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#wenzel">Wenzel (surface-engulfed)  or Cassie-Baxter (water-suspended)</a> state [<a  href="ref36.html#r3548" name="r3548" title="go to cited reference" id="r3548">3548</a>]. At multi-charged surfaces, such as the clay-water interface, the arrangement of the water molecules depends on the density of charges. At low surface charges, the water structuring has low stability and is liquid-like, but the water structuring shows higher stability and is ice-like at high surface charges [<a  href="ref38.html#r3723" name="r3723" title="go to cited reference" id="r3723">3723</a>]. </p>

There is a sudden rearrangement of the structure of the interfacial aqueous layer  (a field-induced phase transition of interfacial water) when the  electrode potentials change between negative and neutral or positive. When a negative charge is imposed, the free-hydroxy moiety points towards the graphene. However, if the surface becomes neutral or positive, the free-hydroxy species orient away from graphene and towards bulk water, finding hydrogen bonding partners.</p>

    <h2><a name="ice" id="ice"></a>The surface of ice (Why is ice slippery?) </h2>
    <p align="left">There are reviews concerning the surface of ice [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3006">3006</a><a name="r3006" id="r3006"></a>] and why it is slippery [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref14.html#r1303">1303</a><a name="r1303" id="r3003"></a>]. Hexagonal ice is a very soft material (1.5 on 
      the Mohs scale) being scratched by most crystalline solids except 
      soapstone, Mg<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>. The surface is liquid below 0&nbsp;&deg;C   (as originally described by Michael Faraday in 1850 [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref45.html#r4467">4467</a><a name="r4467" id="r4467"></a>]) due to the <a href="density_anomalies.html#Pmelt" title="more on the effect of pressure on ice">pressure melting</a> caused by the one-sided attractive interaction with the underlying solid ice [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1686">1686</a><a name="r1686" id="r1686"></a>].  The solid hexagonal and cubic ice surfaces reorganize to reduce the electrostatic repulsion between non&ndash;hydrogen-bonded water molecules and reduce the number and density of the dangling hydrogen atoms [<a  href="ref41.html#r4075" name="r4075" title="go to cited reference" id="r4075">4075</a>]. Using ultrafast surface-specific spectroscopy, the vibrational dynamics of the solidified water molecules at the surface of ice were found to be  faster than those of liquid water  if hydrogen-bonded but slower and with longer lifetimes if the dangling-OH groups were considered [<a  href="ref41.html#r4077" name="r4077" title="go to cited reference" id="r4077">4077</a>]. There is good evidence that the surface 
      layer is indistinguishable from normal liquid water with a 
    thickness that depends upon the temperature (that is, the further below the freezing point, the thinner the layer; it being many nanometers thick at -1&nbsp;&deg;C but has almost disappeared by about -38&nbsp;&deg;C). Other  workers report that the surface layer has different flow properties, with much  higher viscoelasticity, intermediate between liquid water and ice  [<a  href="ref39.html#r3834" name="r3834" title="go to cited reference" id="r3834">3834</a>]. Combined molecular dynamics simulations and sum-frequency generation spectroscopy measurements have shown that hydrogen bonds start to be  lost within the topmost ice surface at around -90&nbsp;&deg;C [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref36.html#r3553">3553</a><a name="r3553" id="r3553"></a>]. As the temperature rises, this disorder extends to the  second layer  at around &minus;16&nbsp;&deg;C, with further bilayer-by-bilayer disorder until the temperature reaches &minus;2&nbsp;&deg;C. Above this, quasi-liquid droplets and films  emerge randomly up to ~100 nm thick on the top of the ice surface dependent on the methodology [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref36.html#r3553">3553</a>], with the outer water molecules having less than three hydrogen bonds and acting like 'ball bearings'  aiding the slipperiness of the water. There appears to be  a weakening of the hydrogen-bonded structure of the outermost water (corrugated) layers on the basal face at 257 K. This has been  interpreted  as a stepwise change from one to two molten layers  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref29.html#r2842">2842</a><a name="r2842" id="r2842"></a>]. Indeed, different protocols have given rise to a wide range of apparent thicknesses of this outermost liquid-like layer   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3385">3385</a><a name="r3385" id="r3385"></a>].</p>

    <p align="left">The structure of the surface of ice remains unclear (well-reviewed in [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref36.html#r3559">3559</a><a name="r3559" id="r3559"></a>]). It has been proposed that the quasi-liquid layer is made up of two-phase types  that exhibit different morphologies (droplets and thin layers)  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref26.html#r2581">2581</a><a name="r2581" id="r2581"></a>]. The surfaces can be examined by laser confocal microscopy combined with differential interference contrast microscopy (LCM-DIM), which can directly visualize the 0.37-nm-thick elementary steps on the ice crystal surface. The nonequilibrium growth of these layers seems to  form  by the deposition of (critically) supersaturated water vapor onto the ice surface rather than by  the surface melting of the ice or the sublimation of ice caused by undersaturated water vapor  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref26.html#r2581">2581</a>]. An alternative proposal is that the surface consists of two layers [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3221">3221</a><a name="r3221" id="r3221"></a>].  In the outer part,  both the proton and oxygen sublattices are melted whereas in  the inner part only the proton sublattice is melted with the oxygen sublattice stable. Another alternative proposal, using surface-responsive  sum-frequency generation spectroscopy, is that the surface layer behaves like supercooled water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3314">3314</a><a name="r3314" id="r3314"></a>]. The surface of ice is self-healing, with micrometer deep scratches in the ice surface spontaneously disappearing  on a time scale of roughly an hour due to sublimation from and condensation onto the ice surface  [<a  href="ref45.html#r4422" name="r4422" title="go to cited reference" id="r4422">4422</a>].</p>
    <p align="left"><br />
</p>
    <p align="left">As the surface of ice, near its melting point and exposed to the air, is partially melted, it can take up gases, ions, and organic molecules with ease. Dissolved materials lower the freezing point, and so increase the thickness of the molten layer. Also, reactions take place within this liquid-like phase. However, the pre-melted surface of ice has unique solvation properties, different from those of liquid water, in that ions dissolve but small molecular weight hydrophilic organic molecules, such as glyoxal (O=CH-CH=O), do not  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2969">2969</a><a name="r2969" id="r2969"></a>]. At low temperatures (&asymp; 150 K), the melted surface layer has wholly disappeared, and the   ice surface is highly ordered. It has two surface-specific vibrational modes at higher frequencies (&sim;3530 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> and &sim;3700 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3001">3001</a><a name="r3001" id="r3001"></a>]. The vibration at &sim;3700 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> corresponds to the free surface hydroxyl group, whereas the &sim;3530 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> vibration corresponds to  surface water molecules involving the free surface lone pair. Vibrational spectroscopy has found that the basal face of hexagonal ice at 100 K possesses order. One of each surface -O-H groups in its H<sub>2</sub>O molecules is perpendicular, facing the air (an &quot;H-up&quot; hydrogen ordered surface). At this temperature, there is no quasi-liquid layer  on the ice surface. Such ordering is not found in the bulk. However, the hydrogen bond network of water at the surface has more degrees of freedom for molecular translation and rotation, which  makes the surface hydrogen ordering possible   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3911">3911</a><a name="r3911" id="r3911"></a>]. </p>

    <p align="left">Although ice is often perceived as 'slippery' 
      (for example, ice skating), it is also very 'sticky' (for example, the difficulty in removing ice from  car windscreens, 
      the compaction of snow to form 'snowballs' and the ease with 
      which two ice cubes stick together). The underlying slipperiness of  ice can be explained by the tetrahedral open structuring [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1859">1859</a><a name="r1859" id="r1859"></a>] of the liquid water surface that aids the formation of a slipping plane on confinement, whereas its 'stickiness' is due to  the refreezing of liquid water confined between ice surfaces, and forming greater than two hydrogen bonds each, so 'fixing' the surfaces disallowing movement. <a href="capillaries.html">Capillary condensation</a> of liquid water between a tungsten tip and a hydrophobic graphite surface using a friction force microscope has been proposed to form a sticky 'ice' at room temperature [<a href="ref11.html#r1033">1033</a><a name="r1033" id="r1033"></a>].<sup><a name="bl" id="bl"></a><a title="click for more" href="interfacial_water.html#l"> f</a></sup> These different perceptions

      heating  with the low thermal conductivity of ice, reducing 
      heat  loss. Also, there is a deformation of the ice, on skating, due to the pressure and the ease that the ice may deform (plowing). The trails behind the skates are due to both the melting and the plowing.  At low skating speeds, the plowing dominates, while at high speeds the friction in the water layer dominates   [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2944">2944</a><a name="r2944" id="r2944"></a>]. Usually, skates are tilted, clearly on curves but also on straights. Such tilted skate edges increase the friction substantially, even for small tilts, and this increase is more pronounced at higher velocities  [<a href="ref38.html#r3797" name="r3797" title="go to cited reference" id="r3797">3797</a>]. Ice-on-ice friction both with and without water on the ice surface has been investigated [<a href="ref40.html#r3905" name="r3905" title="go to cited reference" id="r3905">3905</a>].

    <p>For example, the 100 face of a platinum crystal is four-coordinated, allowing a hydrogen-bonded water sheet to form (see <a href="interfacial_water.html#100">right  top</a> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2733">2733</a><a name="r2733" id="r2733"></a>]).

However, the platinum is locally six-coordinated and frustrates water's hydrogen-bonding in the first layer so leaving further bonding sites on the effective hydrophilic surface layer and allowing further water to spread [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2733">2733</a>]. The interfacial water molecules can diffuse within layers and exchange with secondary hydrating water through hydrogen bond rearrangements and quantum tunneling. Due to the different binding of the 111 face compared with the 100 face, the relaxation times of water molecules adsorbed on the 111 face are much faster [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2736">2736</a><a name="r2736" id="r2736"></a>].

    <p>The hydrophobicity of a naturally hydrophilic Pt-surface depends on its curvature.

Although often proposed to be due to the 'slipping plane' charge, it probably lies well within the unstirred surface layer (except when maximally moved by an electric field) and several water diameters away from the charged surface. It is likely to be close to, if numerically smaller than, the actual surface potential of the nanobubble (particle) as the surface charge is counteracted by a smaller amount of counter-ion held nearby. The key parameter determining the position of the slip plane and the &zeta;-potential of colloids is the surface hydration. Although the exact physical meaning of the &zeta;-potential is unclear, it does indicate the electrostatic interaction between particles. The zeta potential keeps similarly charged particles apart, and when it is counteracted, the particles often coalesce (flocculate). The unstirred layer also marks the  vicinity of the surface where the concentrations are different from their value in the bulk solution (the diffusioin layer of thickness  the Debye length, &kappa;<sup>&minus;1 </sup>).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Zeta potential  is readily determined from the movement of such particles in an electric field and depends on the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) and viscosity. It is calculated using the Smoluchowski equation.</p>

        <p>The charge on the surface of theoretically modeled water  without dissociation changes the charge across the surface that depends on the depth of the surface examined, as indicated opposite [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1348">1348</a><a name="r1348" id="r22"></a>a]. Thus overall, it is negative (relative to a positive bulk) but where the very outer layer of the interface (next to the gas) is more positive [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1348">1348</a>c]. The outer (gas-facing) positive contribution is due to the almost-free singly-linked water molecules compensating for the negative quadrupole and dipole contributions in the denser part of the surface layer [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1348">1348</a>b]. An explicit <em>ab initio</em> electronic charge density study shows that a negative exterior surface may be present due to electron density 'leaking' into the gas phase (suggested by the dotted line opposite), and not because of any preferential orientation of water molecules [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1721">1721</a><a name="r1721" id="r23"></a>]. However, this may have a consequential orientation effect similar to the description above.</p>

It should be noted that the vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy of the broad and nonzero signal intensity between 1700 and 3000 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> showed no evidence for the adsorption of either H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>&minus;</sup> in a pH range extending between at least pH 2 and pH 11 [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3488">3488</a><a name="r3488" id="r3488"></a>]. Molecular modeling is restrictive to the number of molecules used and usually has just a single ion (H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>&minus;</sup>) with a few (e.g., a thousand or so) water molecules. It should be recognized that such situations are far from realistic as there are no counter-ion effects, the pH's are effectively extreme (pH &asymp; 1 for H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>), and the particles are charged; such models usually give the H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> on the surface with the OH<sup>&minus;</sup> ion buried   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2577">2577</a><a name="r2577" id="r27"></a>].

Also, there are good reasons to suppose that the  negative surface region is  a different aqueous phase, perhaps similar to a liquid crystal, that extends for up to hundreds of nanometers or even further  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1328">1328</a>a].

        <p> There is some dispute over the charge on the surface at pH 7 [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1205">1205</a>]. Part of this dispute may be due to the ambiguity in what is meant by 'surface'; is it the very outside, or is it several molecular dimensions deep as found with the 'slipping plane'.

Also, they may attract hydroxide ions and eliminate their charge by forming water. Using acid concentrations (HCl, HBr, HI) in the range 1 - 300 mM (i.e., pH 0 - 3), it has also been found that the surface adsorption of hydronium ions is independent of any specific proton-halide anion interactions and follows a constant adsorption free energy, <span class="style2">D</span>G ~ &ndash;3.74 (&plusmn;0.56) kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> corresponding to a reduction of the surface pH with respect to the bulk value by 0.66 (&plusmn;0.10).</p>

    <h2><a name="j" id="j">j</a> Evaporation and condensation</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Evaporation is a surface phenomenon where bulk bubbles cannot form as the vapor pressure is lower than the atmospheric pressure. Evaporation differs from boiling, which is a bulk liquid phenomenon where the saturated vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure, with bubbles of water vapor forming in the bulk. There is a net evaporation (loss) of liquid water from its surface so long as the <a href="steam.html#humid">surrounding gas phase</a> is not saturated with water vapor (see <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#l">humidity</a>, <a href="steam.html#air">air-borne water</a>, and <a href="water_on_Earth.html#maps">humidity maps</a>). There is  net condensation (gain) of liquid water when the surrounding gas phase is  saturated with water vapor, and the surface is cooler than the <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#dewpt">dew point</a>. Under all conditions, however, there is both evaporation and condensation at differently controlled rates. Both are nonequilibrium processes. There is a rapid flux at the surface. About a hundred million  water molecules per second impinge each square nanometer at 25 &deg;C. At equilibrium, the same number of molecules leave the liquid phase, with the average residence time for a water molecule on the surface about 0.1 &mu;s.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As evaporation is an endothermic process, it  cools the liquid and heats the air.
          As the specific heat of gaseous water (~34 <a href="constants.html#J" title="joule">J</a> &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; K<sup>&minus;</sup><sup>1</sup>) is one-half that of liquid water (~75 <a href="constants.html#J" title="joule">J</a> &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> &#739; K<sup>&minus;1</sup>), the  gas temperature rises twice as much as the water is cooled. Clearly, condensation heats the liquid and cools the air. In an enclosed environment, a liquid will evaporate until the surrounding air is saturated.  Above an evaporating aqueous surface, the humid air is less dense than dry air and will, therefore, rise to drive convective currents and change the boundary conditions. Air becomes lighter as we add water to it. It is a mistake to conclude that, as the bulk water cools on evaporation,  the boundary gas also cools enough to 'fix' the boundary layer of gas in place, as this gas heats up. On the other hand, the drier air when condensing will be denser and cooler and tend not to move. Condensation commonly occurs when a gas containing vapor is cooled  to its saturation limit, such as when warm, humid air inside a dwelling hits a cold external wall. The two processes of evaporation and condensation are not, therefore, the reverse as each other.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Evaporation of water from the oceans keeps the oceans cool and the air warmer. Humid air absorbs infrared energy (the most prominent greenhouse effect) and acts as a blanket at night to keep nights from getting too cold. In low-humidity deserts, even in the tropics, nights can be quite cold without this blanket. As the   water vapor content in the air may be restricted by temperature and pressure, moist air may deviate significantly from an <a href="steam.html#d">ideal gas</a> compared to dry air. Increasing the water vapor in the air, at constant temperature and pressure increases its volume. Evaporation of water from our skin, due to perspiration with subsequent evaporation, keeps us cool. If the <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#l">relative humidity</a> is high, this process cannot function, and we may become uncomfortably hot. More blood may come to our skin to attempt to cool, less blood goes to the active muscles and the brain, physical strength and alertness decline, in extreme resulting in heatstroke. As an example, if the air temperature is  29 &deg;C (85&nbsp;&deg;F), a person feels it cooler at 26 &deg;C (78&nbsp;&deg;F) at zero humidity but much hotter as 42 &deg;C (108&nbsp;&deg;F) at 100% humidity. Similarly, keeping a house more humid when cold makes it feel warmer. Since it costs a lot less to humidify the air than to heat it, a humidifier saves  money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The mechanism and rates of evaporation and condensation have proved very difficult to model, with orders-of-magnitude different results being produced [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2759">2759</a><a name="r2759" id="r2759"></a>]. One reason for this is that the processes are rare on modeling timescales, and therefore   it&rsquo;s challenging (expensive) to model those phenomena by computer   simulations. A significant  complexity in this (generally) nonequilibrium phenomenon  is a difference in temperature between the liquid surface and the interfacial vapor, <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="interfacial_water.html#m"> g</a><a name="bm" id="bm"></a></sup> depending on the vapor pressure and the temperatures of  bulk liquid and  bulk vapor.  Even the direction of the discontinuity has proved contentious. The two empirical parameters used are the condensation and evaporation coefficients, originally defined as:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">condensation coefficient =&nbsp;<u>&nbsp; number of molecules absorbed by the liquid phase</u></p>

    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evaporation coefficient = <u>number of molecules transferred to the vapor phase</u></p>

    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Both values are proposed to be between 0 and 1 but may not be constant or equal, even at equilibrium. Also, the values depend on their precise definitions in terms of distance and timescale. The experimental values for these coefficients depend on the underlying theory but may lie orders of magnitude below unity and are very different to each other and between different researchers. The primary reason for the condensation coefficient being less than unity is that impinging molecules may knock out an existing molecule from the liquid or they simply bounce off. The primary reasons for the evaporation coefficient being less than unity is that leaving molecules may bounce back from  molecules in the vapor or merely be replaced by vapor molecules [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2760">2760</a><a name="r2760" id="r2760"></a>]. It is difficult to  separate the two processes experimentally, but this can be achieved by using liquid microjets    in a vacuum system with evaporation without any condensation.</p>

The validity of the equation has been questioned, and other versions of this equation exist that make different assumptions. Water's surface presents a more complex and anomalous environment than  other liquids that is best examined by experiment rather than theory. Also, natural open systems will behave very differently from closed systems, even at equilibrium. Unfortunately, experiments are challenging, and the experimental processes may interfere with the evaporation/condensation processes (e.g., temperature determinations across the interfaces).</p>

	  <p align="left">The <a href="colligative_generation.html#knud">Knudsen</a> layer is the nonequilibrium unstirred layer  on the gas side of the gas-liquid interface. The thickness of this layer is several times the mean free path of the mixture. The mean free path is proportional to the (gaseous) viscosity and the square root of the temperature and inversely proportional to the pressure and the square root of the molecular mass of the mixture. At 20&nbsp;&deg;C and atmospheric pressure, the mean-free path of water vapor and dry air are 2.16 &micro;m and 0.07 &micro;m [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2714">2714</a>]. In  this layer, intermolecular collisions, including the heavier non-condensable  gases  present (e.g., O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>),  cause substantial changes to the velocity distributions  [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3387">3387</a><a name="r3387" id="r3387"></a>].</p>

    <p align="left">Water evaporation from aqueous solutions may lead to the build-up of structure(s) and composition gradients at their interface with air,with the evaporation rate decreasing with time(t) as t<sup>&frac12;</sup> and dependent on the rate of diffusion [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3345">3345</a><a name="r3345" id="r3345"></a>]. The effect of HCl on the evaporative flux is complex, with an increase of 45% (relative to pure water) in 0.1 M HCl and a decrease of 60% in 1 M HCl [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3307">3307</a><a name="r3307" id="r3307"></a>].</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The   evaporation rates of both water droplets and ice crystals are limited by the diffusive transport of the vapor away. Therefore, the evaporation from ice and snow (sublimation) is  similar to that of water drops  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3446">3446</a><a name="r3446" id="r3446"></a>]. The rate of ice crystal sublimation is significant as it has a major impact on global climate since surface ice and snow determine Earth&rsquo;s albedo. The  vapor pressure and evaporation rate of an ideal A:B liquid binary mixture  varies linearly with the concentration of A and B species when A:A, A:B, and  B:B interactions are identical. When the A:B interactions are stronger than the  A:A and B interactions, such as in water-formic acid mixtures, the vapor  pressure of water-formic acid mixtures is markedly lower than predicted  Raoult&rsquo;s law, and the evaporation rate is also lower [<a  href="ref44.html#r4356" name="r4356" title="go to cited reference" id="r4356">4356</a>]. However, when these interactions are weaker  such as in water-methanol mixtures, the vapor pressure and evaporation rate are markedly higher.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">An interesting phenomenon of evaporation is the boiling water challenge. Boiling water tossed into an icy atmosphere (&lt;~ -25&nbsp;&deg;C) immediately turns to snow. This only works if the water is close to boiling (&gt;~ 93&deg;C; i.e., snow is made using boiling water and not cold or warm water). The water passes through three states almost instantaneously, liquid <img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" /> gas <img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" /> liquid <img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" /> solid. The hot water evaporates quickly (as it is hot) to gaseous steam, which then cannot be held by the cold atmospheric gas and condenses into a cloud of tiny droplets with large relative surface area per mass, that then freeze to form snow. To supplement natural snow at skiing resorts, snow-makers blow dry air and water into a cold, dry atmosphere where clouds of fine cold droplets cool further by evaporation and freeze to form snow. This artificial snow lasts longer than natural snow as it is more compact and melts more slowly.</p>

    <h2><a name="c" id="c2"></a>Thermodynamics of the liquid-gas surface for water</h2>
        <p>At the liquid-gas surface the following thermodynamic relationship holds:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>dG = -SdT + VdP + &gamma;dA + &Sigma;<sub>i</sub> &mu;dn<sub>i</sub></strong></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p>where G, U, S,	T,	V,	P,	&gamma;, A, &mu; and n<sub>i</sub> are the thermodynamic quantities, Gibbs (free) energy, internal energy, entropy, temperature, volume, pressure, surface tension, surface area, chemical potential and number of moles of substance i, respectively.</p>
        <p>From the properties of the differential:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/stt1.gif" alt="(dV/dA)TPn=(dgamma/dP)TAn" width="133" height="47" align="middle" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/stt2.gif" alt="(dS/dA)TPn=-(dgamma/dT)PAn" width="141" height="47" align="middle" />.</p>
        <p><a name="max" id="max2"></a>Also, there is the Maxwell relation <img src="images/stt16.gif" alt="(dS/dV)T=(dP/dT)V" width="110" height="47" align="middle" /> (see. for example [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1287">1287</a><a name="r1287" id="r4"></a>]).</p>
    <p>Although <img src="images/stt12.gif" alt="(dV/dA)TPn" width="60" height="47" align="middle" /> has units of length, this may be misleading. It is better to consider its reciprocal <img src="images/stt14.gif" alt="(dA/dV)TPn" width="60" height="47" align="middle" /> as a measure of a difference in density between surface and bulk density. <br />
          <br />
      As H = G + TS,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/stt4.gif" alt="(dH/dA)TPn=(dG/dA)TPn + T(dS/dA)TPn" width="215" height="47" align="middle" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/stt5.gif" alt="(dH/dA)TPn=gamma - T(dgamma/dT)PAn" width="164" height="47" align="middle" /> (surface enthalpy). </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>From inspection of the <a  title="go for more information" href="physical_anomalies.html#stt">surface tension changes with temperature</a>, it is clear that this term (the <a title="go for more information" href="water_properties.html#senth">surface enthalpy</a>) is always positive. </p>
        <p>As H = U + PV,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/stt6.gif" alt="(dH/dA)TPn=(dU/dA)TPn + P(dV/dA)TPn" width="214" height="47" align="middle" /></p>
    <p><br />
      Also, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/stt7.gif" alt="(dU/dA)TPn =(dU/dV)TPn  x (dV/dA)TPn " width="201" height="47" align="middle" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/stt8.gif" alt="(dU/dV)TPn=Pi=internal pressure" width="230" height="47" align="middle" />.</p>
        <p>Therefore, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/stt9.gif" alt="(dH/dA)TPn=(Pi + P)x(dV/dA)TPn" width="197" height="47" align="middle" /></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The internal (cohesive) pressure (<a href="water_properties.html#cohp">&Pi;<sub>i</sub></a>) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1279">1279</a><a name="r1279" id="r5"></a>] is the work required to increase the volume at a constant temperature, a constant external pressure, and constant solute concentrations, having the same units as pressure. </p>
        <p>As dU = TdS - PdV,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="images/stt18.gif" alt="(dU/dV)T =T(dP/dT)V  - P" width="146" height="44" align="middle" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<a href="interfacial_water.html#max">see above</a>),</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>and as, the internal pressure may be calculated from (&Pi;<sub>i</sub> + P) = T&alpha;/&beta;<sub>T</sub>, where &alpha; is the coefficient of <a title="go for more information" href="data1.html">thermal expansion</a> and &beta;<sub>T</sub> is the coefficient of <a title="go for more information" href="data1.html">isothermal compressibility</a> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1279">1279</a>]. </p>

    <p align="center"><img src="images/stt10.gif" alt="(dA/dV)TPn=(Pi + P)/(gamma - T(dgamma/dT)PAn)" width="232" height="69" align="middle" /> and <img src="images/stt11.gif" alt="(dgamma/dP)TAn=(dA/dV)TPn=(gamma - T(dgamma/dT)PAn/(Pi + P)" width="235" height="71" align="middle" /> </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As T&alpha;/&beta;<sub>T</sub> is zero at 3.984&nbsp;&deg;C, so is (&Pi;<sub>i</sub> + P)  and both are negative below this temperature, as must be; &Pi;<sub>i</sub> is zero at 3.99&nbsp;&deg;C when cohesive and repulsive components of the hydrogen-bonding are equal.  It follows that the densities of surface and bulk water are equal at a temperature of 3.984&nbsp;&deg;C  as, below this temperature, the surface density contracts relative to the bulk density (somewhat like what happens at the surface of hexagonal ice [<a href="ref10.html#r937">937</a>] ). Thus below a temperature of 3.984&nbsp;&deg;C, the bulk liquid is less dense than the surface liquid, while above this temperature, the bulk liquid is denser than the surface liquid. </p>

    <p><a name="p" id="p"></a><sup>j</sup>&nbsp;The source of this negative charge at the oil-water interface has been established  (in 2021) as due to the unexpected strong charge-transfer interactions that arise from interfacial C&ndash;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O hydrogen bonds [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref44.html#r4385">4385</a><a name="r4385" id="r4385"></a>]. Water at the oil-water interface had a stronger hydrogen bonding compared with the air-water interface.
