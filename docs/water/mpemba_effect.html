<h2><a name="mpemba" id="mpemba"></a>Hot water may 
      freeze faster than cold water</h2>
    <p>It  is generally anticipated that cooling a hot system will take longer than  cooling an identical but cooler system.  Surprisingly, this is not always the case in water and magnetic alloys [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3465">3465</a><a name="r3465" id="r3465"></a>], where it is observed that a hot system can be cooled faster. For  many years, it has been known that pre-boiled water freezes before unboiled  water if starting from the same (ambient) temperature.<sup><a title="click for further information" href="#f">f</a><a name="bf" id="bf"></a></sup> This has been recognized even as far back as Aristotle [<a href="ref21.html#r2043" name="r2043" title="go to cited reference" id="r2">2043</a>], who stated<em> &quot;The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly: for so it cools sooner</em>&quot;. Also, it is well-known that hot-water pipes are more prone to bursting in cold weather than cold-water pipes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The ability of hot water to freeze faster than cold seems 
      counter-intuitive as it would seem that hot water must first 
      become cold water, and therefore, the time required for this 
      will always delay its freezing relative to cold water. However, 
      experiments show that there is a non-equilibrium process by which unstirred hot water (for example, 90&nbsp;&deg;C) 
      does often (but by no means always) appear to freeze faster 
      than the same amount of unstirred cold water (for example, 18&nbsp;&deg;C) 
      under otherwise identical conditions [<a href="ref2.html#r158" name="r158" title="go to cited reference" id="r158">158</a>] (see also graph below left  [<a href="ref29.html#r2810" name="r2810" title="go to cited reference" id="r2810">2810</a>] ). The Mpemba effect has been proven in spin glass (a type of disordered magnet)   [<a href="ref38.html#r3708" name="r3708" title="go to cited reference" id="r3708">3708</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Mpemba effect, '<em>Hot water may 
      freeze faster than cold water</em>', was brought to the attention 
      of the scientific community by the perseverance of Erasto 
      Mpemba [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1388">1388</a><a name="r1388" id="r1388"></a>], a 13-year-old Tanzanian schoolboy<sup><a title="click for further information" href="#a"> a</a><a name="ba" id="ba"></a></sup> who refused 
      to reject his own evidence or bow to disbelieving mockery, 
      that he could freeze ice cream faster if he warmed it first. The Mpemba effect and its reverse (a cooler sample may heat faster than a hotter sample) have been shown, by theory and computation, to exist in the simple system of a uniform granular fluid [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3112">3112</a><a name="r3112" id="r3112"></a>]. The rationale for this is that some particles may be given more energy than others, even if the mean temperature is unchanged, a theory that fits even better with the <a href="cluster_history.html">2-state hypothesis </a>for water. Similar behavior has been observed in  carbon nano-tubes resonators [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3113">3113</a><a name="r3113" id="r3113"></a>]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the Mpemba effect (Hot water may 
      freeze faster than cold water) is not well formulated for precise testing as the temperatures are not stated, nor is the amount of freezing. It was never meant to be precisely determinable, as are other anomalies such as the temperature of maximum density, but more as a fascinating natural phenomenon that has been noticed since the beginning of recorded history and contains an &nbsp;exciting and edifying story for students. No standard experimental setup is described, with various cooling regimes being used, causing differences in observations and explanations depending on, for example, the base cooling temperature. Generally, it is accepted that the typical difference in start temperatures may be about 40&nbsp;&deg;C, and the extent of freezing is that it should be visibly extensive but not complete. In the definition, the word 'may' is reasonably  interpreted as 'more often than not', and certainly not as 'always'.</p>

However, there does not seem to be sufficient mass lost in experiments to support such an explanation to be the sole cause  and the Mpemba effect is apparent even when the vessel has a lid. Related to this explanation, part of the cause may be due to the variously sized  and  persistent convective currents created when hot water cools in different experimental setups [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r4164">4164</a><a name="r4164" id="r4164"></a>].  The importance of gas content has been shown to be involved with high statistical certainty   [<a href="ref29.html#r2810" title="go to cited reference" >2810</a>]. Another  scenario concerns the O:H&ndash;O hydrogen bond possessing memory, whose thermal relaxation  intrinsically defines the energy emission rate  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2227">2227</a><a name="r2227" id="r2227"></a>]. This hypothesis  needs further substantiation as individual bonds between neighboring oxygen atoms (of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules) have only fleeting lifetimes,<sup><a title="click for further information" href="#d">d</a><a name="bd" id="bd"></a></sup> Also, there does not appear to be a good reason why the behavior of the O:H&ndash;O hydrogen bond is not fully reversible, and the described cooling curves have  been challenged [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2809">2809</a>].</p>

	<p class="style4">  degree of supercooling.</p></figure></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most 
      likely scenario (described in [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref2.html#r158">158</a>],  disputed [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1415">1415</a><a name="r1415" id="r1415"></a>], but later supported [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2047">2047</a><a name="r2047" id="r2047"></a>]) 
      is that the degree of supercooling is greater, under 
      some circumstances, in initially cold water than initially hot 
    water. <sup><a title="click for further information" href="#g">g</a><a name="bg" id="bg"></a></sup> Indeed, it has been known for over a hundred years that the thermal history of a liquid has an effect upon  the  kinetics  of  phase  transformations to its solid [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3330">3330</a><a name="r3330" id="r3330"></a>]; although often this is the opposite to that found in water with preheating increasing the supercooling effect.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In this case, the initially hot water appears to freeze at 
      a higher temperature (less supercooling). However, less of 
      the apparently frozen ice is solid, and a considerable 
      amount of still-liquid water remains trapped and hidden under an outer ice layer. Initially-cold water 
      freezes at a lower temperature to a more completely 
      solid ice with less included liquid water; the lower 
      temperature causing intensive nucleation and a faster 
      crystal growth rate. If the freezing temperature is 
      kept at about -6&nbsp;&deg;C, then the initially hot water is 
      most likely to (apparently) freeze first. If freezing 
      is continued, initially cold water always completely 
      freezes before initially hot water. After coming to this conclusion, it was found that this explanation for the Mpemba effect was first experimentally determined in 1775 [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1861">1861</a><a name="r1861" id="r1861"></a>]. Many factors, including the temperature of the cooling bath, the material in the cooling bath and the physical dimensions and characteristics of the vessels all affect both the  cooling rate and whether, or not, supercooling occurs [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2281">2281</a><a name="r2281" id="r2281"></a>] such that these factors must be clearly stated and controlled. Such factors must be taken into account when comparing different experimental procedures.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Why initially cold 
      water supercools more is explained in terms of the gas concentration and the clustering 
      of water (an effect on entropy [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2961">2961</a><a name="r2961" id="r"></a>]). Indeed, water behaves differently and possesses a different structuring at the same temperature depending upon whether it is being heated or cooled [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1697">1697</a><a name="r1697" id="r1697"></a>]. Icosahedral clusters do not readily allow 
      the necessary arrangement of water molecules to enable 
      hexagonal ice crystal initiation; such clustering is 
      the cause of the <a title="go to find more information"  href="phase_anomalies.html#cool">facile 
      supercooling of water</a>. Water that is initially cold 
      will have the maximum (equilibrium) concentration of 
      such icosahedral clustering. Initially-hot water has 
      lost much of its ordered clustering (higher entropy [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2961">2961</a>]) and, if the cooling 
      time is sufficiently short, this will not be fully re-attained 
      before freezing. Experiments on the low-density water around macromolecules have shown 
      that such clustering processes may take some time [<a href="ref.html#r4" name="r4" title="go to cited reference" id="r4">4</a>]. Also of relevance here is that the formation of <a title="go to find more information"  href="clathrate_hydrates.html">clathrate ices</a>, which have structures closely related to the icosahedral clusters, behaves oppositely.  Thus, their supercooling (before clathrate ice formation) from hot water is far greater than that from cold water  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref14.html#r1391">1391</a><a name="r1391" id="r1391"></a>].<sup><a title="click for further information" href="#c"> c</a><a name="bc" id="bc"></a></sup> The basis of this explanation has also been given, subsequently based on differences in hydrogen bonding within clusters [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2999">2999</a><a name="r2999" id="r2999"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="nano" id="nano"></a>It has been discovered that the charge on the liquid interface affects the freezing point of supercooled water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1737">1737</a><a name="r1737" id="r1737"></a>]. As the surfaces of <a href="nanobubble.html" title="click for further information">nanobubbles</a> are thought to be negative,  such nanobubbles, with their extensive surface area, are expected to increase supercooling. Heating water containing nanobubbles is expected to destroy nanobubbles as they grow in size due to the lower gas solubility at higher temperatures and dissipate. The Mpemba effect is then simply explained by the loss of nanobubbles in  hot water, which are kinetically too slow to reform on cooling. A theory has been presented for the role of micro/nanobubbles in accelerating heat transfer, and that may increase convective heat<br />
transport [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref43.html#r4240">4240</a><a name="r4240" id="4240"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is also possible that dissolved gases may encourage supercooling 
      ([<a href="ref29.html#r2810" title="go to cited reference" >2810</a>]; mouse over the <a href="#mpemba1">figure above</a> to see the effect of removing the gases) by  increasing the degree of structuring by hydrophobic hydration 
      in the previously cold water relative to the gas-reduced previously-hot 
      water. The critical effect of low dissolved gas concentrations   
      on water structure is reported in [<a href="ref3.html#r294" name="r294" title="go to cited reference" id="r294">294</a>] with
      re-equilibration reported as taking several days. Also, an increase in the pressure 
      as gas comes out of the solution when the water starts to freeze, 
       lowering the freezing point and reducing the tendency to freeze 
      (<a href="guestbl2.html#mpemba">see the guestbook</a>).&nbsp;Also,  tiny gas bubbles (cavities produced on heating), with their more extensive liquid-gas interface, may increase the 
      rate of nucleation,  reducing supercooling [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref5.html#r428">428</a><a name="r428" id="r428"></a>]. Another possibility has been described depending on changes in any dissolved material with temperature (such as the reduction in bicarbonate in heated 'hard' water), but this has not yet been experimentally tested [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref11.html#r1014">1014</a><a name="r1014" id="r1014"></a>]. The rationale for the Mpemba effect, in this case, concerns differences in the solute concentration at the ice-liquid interface, causing a localized <a title="go to find more information"  href="material_anomalies.html#e">lowering of the melting point</a> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref11.html#r1014">1014</a>]. </p>
    <h2><a name="mis" id="mis"></a>Grossly misleading paper</h2>
    <p>Rarely does this website take the trouble to criticize scientific publications, but a 2016 paper that  appeared in Nature, Scientific Reports [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2809">2809a</a><a name="r2809" id="r2809"></a>], together with its BBC radio commentary, are highly misleading and require a response. <sup><a title="click for further information" href="#e">e</a><a name="be" id="be"></a></sup> The Mpemba effect concerns supercooling, and the formation of ice, whereas this paper only involves cooling to 0&nbsp;&deg;C or 4&nbsp;&deg;C, but (importantly) avoids supercooling and ice formation and so, despite its title, is not concerned experimentally with the Mpemba effect but with the simple cooling of liquid water. The paper shows that cold water cools to 0&nbsp;&deg;C faster than hot water. This seems to support the view given above that the Mpemba effect is down to differences in the supercooling of previously hot and cold liquid water. The paper [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2809">2809a</a>] neither proves nor disproves the Mpemba effect;' Hot water may 
      freeze faster than cold water'.<sup><a title="click for further information" href="#e"> e</a></sup></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> <a name="bur" id="bur"></a>As a postscript: a further paper by Burridge [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2809">2809b</a>] supports his earlier paper's mistaken 'definition of the Mpemba effect'. However, it does not introduce any papers that support his  invented definition. In this new and interesting paper, he concludes, &quot;the initially warmer sample ... is observed to achieve complete freezing in a significantly shorter time than the initially cooler sample&quot;, using non-identical duplicates but dependent on the roughness of the containers, and hence the supercooling.</p>

    <p><a name="e" id="e"><sup>e</sup></a> Burridge and  Linden&rsquo;s paper   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2809">2809</a>] misstates what is known as the Mpemba effect [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2877">2877</a><a name="r2877" id="r2877"></a>]. In their Abstract, the authors  state that the Mpemba effect is &ldquo;<span class="style6"><em>the  assertion that it is quicker to cool water to a given temperature when the  initial temperature is higher</em>&rdquo;</span>. However, the early paper by Mpemba and Osborne  &nbsp;[<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1388">1388</a>]&nbsp;states, &ldquo;<em class="style8">If two systems are cooled, the water that starts hotter  may freeze first</em>&rdquo;. Follow-up papers (for example [<a href="ref2.html#r158" title="go to cited reference">158</a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref10.html#r959">959</a><a href="ref29.html#r2810"   title="go to cited reference"  >, </a><a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1921">1921</a>, <a href="ref29.html#r2810"   title="go to cited reference"  >2810</a>]) always have included the process of  freezing within the Mpemba effect. In the <a href="http://www.rsc.org/mpemba-competition/" title="click to go to the RSC site"    target="otherWin3" onclick="newWin('otherWin3')">Royal Society of  Chemistry</a>&rsquo;s competition inviting discussion of the effect in 2012, the Mpemba  effect was defined as &nbsp;&ldquo;<span class="style8"><em class="style8">The Mpemba effect  is the phenomenon where hot water freezes quicker than cold water</em></span>&rdquo; and the  competition received 22,000 entrants. A similar invitation from the Journal 'Temperature' (ISSN: 2332-8940) gave its definition as &quot;<span class="style8">warm water freezes more quickly than cold water</span>&quot;  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref10.html#r959">959c</a>]. All previous discussions of the  Mpemba effect have involved a visible formation of ice and include the observation that hot water initially freezes faster than cold water,  at least some of the time.</p>        
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Burridge and  Linden&rsquo;s paper  takes the view that &ldquo;<em class="style6">Broadly  speaking, when two samples of water are cooled to the same temperature, in the  same manner with the two samples being identical except for their initial  temperature, and the initially hotter sample cools in less time, one can  consider the Mpemba effect to have been observed</em>&rdquo;. This mis-definition of the  Mpemba effect considers cooling to a low temperature to be (mistakenly) the  same as cooling to, and including, visible ice formation. Their paper  presents experimental results, but only for the cooling process to  temperatures well above those of freezing water and certainly not including the  freezing process, which was never observed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>        
    <p>Burridge and  Linden  dismiss all prior studies that included supercooling and  freezing with a blanket statement that they are not meaningful. In so doing, they reject the observations of  many scientists, including G. S. Kell [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1390">1390</a>], without presenting their  experimental evidence and with no support from any prior experiments. Of the Vynnycky and. Kimura study [<a href="ref2.html#r158"  title="go to cited reference" >158</a>], they state &ldquo;<span class="style6"><em>exhibited no evidence  of the Mpemba effect</em>&rdquo;</span>, but the paper  states the contrary in its Abstract<span class="style6"> &ldquo;<em class="style8">the effect  of supercooling leads to a spread in the experimental freezing times, giving  results that constitute evidence of the occurrence of the Mpemba effect</em></span>&rdquo;. Burridge and Linden disregard data in this  paper as it &ldquo;<em class="style6">cannot be fairly included in our analysis, since we exclude  the freezing process</em>&rdquo;.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>        
    <p>It is unsurprising that Burridge and Linden state &ldquo;<em class="style6">We conclude  that despite our best efforts, we were not able to make observations of any  physical effects which could reasonably be described as the Mpemba effect</em>&rdquo; as they  never performed any experiments nor made any associated observations in any attempt to do so. It is also clear from  their paper that Burridge and Linden  misunderstand the correct and widely-understood definition of the Mpemba effect </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>        
    <p>There have  been many attempts to explain the Mpemba effect, with supercooling  often being  cited. Thirty years ago, Wojciechowski <em>et al. </em>[<a href="ref29.html#r2810"   title="go to cited reference"  >2810</a>] concluded that dissolved gases caused this supercooling anomaly with  persuasive statistically meaningful (P &lt; 0.001) experimental results that Burridge and  Linden failed to find. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>To conclude, Burridge and Linden&rsquo;s paper neither proves  nor disproves the Mpemba effect and has a misleading Title and Abstract. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Burridge and Linden's Reply</strong></p>
    <p>Burridge has replied to the points above, and  his unedited reply is given below even though  it is mistaken, misleading and highly contentious. It also misstates comments  made in this website concerning ice formation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style12">'Thank you for  sending these papers. I met with Professor Paul Linden, who as my co-author is  well aware of all of our communications, and we discussed your opinions and the  specific papers which you consider to be evidence. </p>        
    <p class="style12">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style12">We regard the  results of the 2015 paper published by the group at KTH as very strong evidence  that our conclusions are entirely valid. These experiments were carried  out&nbsp;carefully, were well documented and used current technology to improve  precision - they show evidence that the Mpemba effect can be observed but also  strong evidence that the Mpemba effect cannot be observed in a repeatable  meaningful way paper - this is precisely what we concluded.</p>        
    <p class="style12">&nbsp; </p>
    <p class="style12">With regards to  the paper from the 1980's, I am disappointed that I had not found this paper  prior to publishing our article - I would have liked to include reference to  it, and comment upon it. However, Paul and I agree that it would not have  changed our conclusions nor the degree of certainty with which&nbsp;they hold  true.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>        
    <p class="style12">The data  included is&nbsp;interesting. However, like much of the work published on the  Mpemba effect, it is fundamentally flawed. The paper does not clearly define  nor describe details underpinning the matter of primary concern, i.e.&nbsp; how  the to time for freezing to first occur was robustly determined. There are many  issues concerning the formation of ice crystals at the smallest scale which are  not discussed, for example,&nbsp;as you pointed out they can often melt back  into the liquid state before ultimately freezing again. These, and numerous  other experimental issues, result in observations of the  time-for-freezing-to-first-occur&nbsp;being notoriously difficult to make in a  robust and repeatable manner. Without discussion of all of the experimental  difficulties, mitigating procedures, and evidence as to the extent of their  precise effects, it is impossible to know if these results are statistically  significant or not.&nbsp;As such, we still feel entirely able to stand by the  conclusions of our paper. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>        
    <p class="style12">However, if you  are able to repeat this data with documented evidence of all mitigating  procedures, error bounds and uncertainties then we would be delighted to review  this data and once again consider whether our conclusions remain valid. </p>        
    <p class="style12">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="style12">In the absence  of this data, I will cease to respond to any communications, since without this  data our communications have ceased to be fruitful.' </p>
