    <h2><a name="pre" id="pre"></a>The osmotic pressure of particles and membranes</h2>
    <p>Although there remains some contention amongst physical chemists over how to describe osmotic pressure, it is generally agreed that osmotic pressure is a reversible thermodynamic colligative property. It correlates well with other <a href="colligative_properties.html">colligative properties</a> such as the <a href="colligative_properties.html#fptd">freezing point depression</a>. As such, the osmotic pressure  ideally depends on the number of dissolved &lsquo;particles&rsquo; (e.g., molecules) present in a volume of liquid. It is, perhaps, unsurprising that ion exchange surfaces can generate very high osmotic pressures of over 100 MPa in water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1669">1669</a><a name="r1669" id="r1669"></a>], as they create high surface concentrations of counter-ions (100 MPa is the equivalent of 10 km head of water). However, the contained electrolytes in an ion-exchange resin produce a more substantial osmotic pressure than if they were free (uncontained). Thus, nanoparticles coated with immobilized polyelectrolytes can produce up to two hundred times the osmotic pressure than the same quantity of free electrolytes  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2404">2404</a><a name="r2404" id="r2404"></a>], clearly establishing that osmotic pressure can be generated under non-colligative conditions. Poly-ionic nanoparticles, with high surface areas, produce such a substantial osmotic pressure (far more significant than expected  due to counter-ions) <a href="#f"><sup>f</sup></a><a name="bf" id="bf"></a> that they are used in <a href="water_desalination.html#rev">practical desalination processe</a>s  [<a  href="ref18.html#r1768" name="r1768" title="go to cited reference" id="r1768">1768a,d,f,h</a>]. Likewise, polyelectrolytes may also produce high osmotic pressures between molecules (about 100 MPa) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2006">2006</a><a name="r2006" id="r2006"></a>]. However, hydrophilic uncharged molecules such as  dextran and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3277">3277</a><a name="r3277" id="r3277"></a>], without any counter-ions, also produce  high osmotic pressures similar to polyelectrolytes [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2006">2006</a>]. Also, it has been verified experimentally that uncharged <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#philic" title="go to find out more">hydrophilic</a> particle surfaces generate high osmotic pressure without the presence of counter-ions or free solutes  [<a  href="ref18.html#r1768" title="go to cited reference" >1768b,c,g,h,i</a>]. Thus, neutral uncharged triethylene glycolated particles [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2404">2404</a>] and carbon particles coated in neutral N-isopropylacrylamide   [<a  href="ref18.html#r1768" title="go to cited reference" >1768g</a>] both generate considerable osmotic pressure, if  less than similarly coated poly-acrylic acid  particles. Anomalously high osmotic pressures may occur  within low-permeability shale [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2795">2795</a><a name="r2795" id="r2795"></a>]. Therefore, it is clear that relatively small numbers of particles, far less than required by the &lsquo;conventional&rsquo; colligative law, can generate high osmotic pressures so long as they possess extensive hydrophilic surfaces  [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1772">1772</a><a name="r1772" id="r1772"></a>]. This is entirely in agreement with classical (Einstein, [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref9.html#r806">806</a><a name="r806" id="r806"></a>]) ideas concerning osmotic pressure and its relationship to <a href="#" target="Brownian.html">Brownian motion</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The lowered water activity within particles and membranes needs some explanation. First, the water within behaves as though it is under <a href="confined_water.html#phil">hydrophilic confinement</a>, plus it  will be held more strongly due to <a href="capillaries.html#cap">capillarity</a>. Both these effects increase the particles and membranes grip  on their water,  lowering their water activity. Additionally, where polyelectrolytes are concerned, the high concentration of fixed binding sites for the counter-ions prevents their easy loss from the particles or membranes, with any counter-ion loss causing a significant energy-consuming charge separation between the enclosed solution and the bulk.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Osmotic pressure is generated within a confined volume or at a surface when insufficient water can flow onto or away from the surface. The question arises as to what happens next. Tension arises in the neighboring water, or else there will be an interface of neighboring water molecules with very different chemical potentials. Maybe this will be slightly relieved by  releasing  some ions, if present, but with  energetically unfavorable charge separation. Alternatively, the low potential water molecules must transfer their reduced entropy to their neighbors away from the surface until balanced by the averaged energy of 'bulk' water. The reduced entropy will encourage increased organization within the surface of unstirred water. If the water inside a sunken capillary is considered, this effect will cause flow out of a capillary tube  [<a name="r2669" id="r2669"></a><a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2669">2669</a>], followed by a circular flow through the sunken capillary.</p>

    <p>Much work has been done in the laboratory of Gerald Pollack concerning the non-equilibrium mesoscopic properties of aqueous solutions next to surfaces [<a  href="ref14.html#r1328" name="r1328" title="go to cited reference" id="r1328">1328</a>, <a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1740">1740</a><a name="r1740" id="r1740"></a>, <a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2274">2274</a><a name="r2274" id="r2274"></a>, <a  href="ref24.html#r2387" name="r2387" title="go to cited reference" id="r2387">2387</a>, <a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2669">2669</a>]. <a href="#c"><sup>c</sup></a><a name="bc" id="bc"></a> Earlier independent workers have reported similar results going back more than 100 years [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2058">2058</a><a name="r2058" id="r2058"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2751" name="r2751" id="r2751">2751</a>, <a  href="ref28.html#r2790" name="r2790" title="go to cited reference" id="r2790">2790</a>]. In essence, it has been found that the interfacial water next to ionic charged surfaces (e.g., polyacrylate, see right from [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1740">1740</a>], Nafion <a href="#e"><sup>e</sup></a><a name="be" id="be"></a>, charged Pt [<a  href="ref28.html#r2792" name="r2792" title="go to cited reference" id="r2792">2792</a>]), or neutral uncharged (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose acetate, cellulose [<a  href="ref28.html#r2702" name="r2702" title="go to cited reference" id="r2702">2702</a>], quartz [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref28.html#r2715">2715</a><a name="r2715" id="r2715"></a>], titanium dioxide, silicon, colloidal gold, aluminum <a href="#j"><sup>j</sup></a><a name="bj" id="bj"></a>, contact lens, muscle, rabbit cornea [<a  href="ref28.html#r2790" title="go to cited reference">2790</a>], bacteria, and low-water content but hydrophilic fats  [<a  href="ref29.html#r2876" name="r2876" title="go to cited reference" id="r2876">2876</a>]), and hydrophilic surfaces expel positive and negative solutes to the bulk of the solution that may be several hundred microns away. These exclusion zones (named as<abbrev> </abbrev><a href="polywater.html#ez" title="go for more information">EZ-water</a>) are visualized when a wide size range of particles (&gt;10<sup>9 </sup>
    &#739; ) are used, from low molecular weight dyes and salts  [<a  href="ref24.html#r2387" title="go to cited reference" >2387</a>], to proteins, to micron-sized cationic and anionic beads. There seems to be no dispute over the existence of the extensive <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> layers in aqueous solutions next to many surfaces; they are not 'artifacts'. <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>-water is not formed next to hydrophobic surfaces such as Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene). </p>

    <p>With a laser tweezers system, the existence of force fields inside the solute-free <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> has been found to reduce as a function of distance from the surface [<a  href="ref18.html#r1784" name="r1784" title="go to cited reference" id="r1784">1784</a>]. Microspheres introduced into the <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> move away from the interface to the furthest extent of the <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>, so showing the force remains even in the exclusion zone, and no new phase had formed there [<a  href="ref22.html#r2169" name="r2169" title="go to cited reference" id="r2169">2169</a>] (which might have been expected to prevent such movement). The process is a kinetic-diffusive process, like osmosis [<a  href="ref33.html#r3261" name="r3261" title="go to cited reference" id="r3261">3261</a>]. The particles also develop their own EZs  [<a  href="ref28.html#r2704" name="r2704" title="go to cited reference" id="r2704">2704</a>]. The movement of the <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ </abbr>boundary  follows a power law  close to that expected for free diffusion [<a  href="ref22.html#r2169" title="go to cited reference">2169</a>]. Also, the <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>-water has been shown to possess other physical properties such as an absorption peak at 270 nm, a higher refractive index, a greater permittivity, a greater density, a greater viscosity, and a negative charge compared with the bulk water. The 270-nm absorption has also been found unexpectedly in various aqueous solutions of low molecular weight uncolored solutes [<a href="ref14.html#r1328">1328a</a>], showing it to be a property of the water rather than the solutes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Further, it has been found that uncharged hydrophilic <a href="water_desalination.html#rev">reverse osmosis</a> fibrous membranes efficiently operate as osmotic membranes despite possessing larger pores than the usual molecular-sized pores. This finding shows that they must present thick multi-molecular layers of water that are relatively impenetrable to low molecular mass salts and molecules. It has also been independently experimentally verified that uncharged but highly hydrophilic nanoparticles with high surface areas produce such an enormous osmotic pressure that they can be used in practical desalination processes [<a  href="ref18.html#r1768" title="go to cited reference" >1768a,b</a>]. Also, uncharged hydrophilic polymers have been shown to generate  osmotic pressures of greater than MPa at nanoscopic distances  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2006">2006</a>]. The 1 - 3 mm thick interfacial zone of water found at quartz surfaces in  60  &#739; 20 &micro;m<sup>2</sup> quartz cavities has its mprominent infrared peak at 3200 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> indicating more strongly linked hydrogen-bonding   by about +1 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> throughout this zone of vicinal water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref28.html#r2715">2715</a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Electric fields (of about 10<sup>9</sup> V   &#739; m<sup>&minus;1</sup>), in water vapor, form one-dimensional water nanowires consisting of square or pentagonal prism-like structures  along the electric field [<a  href="ref38.html#r3724" name="r3724" title="go to cited reference" id="r3724">3724</a>]. It appears likely that such commonly-found electric fields next to water surfaces initiate such structuring and the related <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> structuring. Vicinal water, 
      extending for tens of nanometers but well within the unstirred 'Nernst' 
      layer near inert solid surfaces, has been found to have properties 
      consistent with the partial conversion to <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#Fig2">low-density 
      water</a>; for example, reduced density (-4%) and raised dielectric, 
      specific heat (+25%), compressibility (+20 - 100%), and viscosity (+200 - 1100%) 
      [<a  href="ref3.html#r205" name="r205" title="go to cited reference" id="r205">205</a>]. The thermodynamic 
      rationale for forming this (interfacial) vicinal water 
      is that the loss of hydrogen bonds at the surface increases the 
      enthalpy necessitating the water molecules to compensate by doing 
      pressure-volume work. The network expands to form 
      low-density water with lower entropy (see also <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">hydrophobic 
      surfaces</a> and, for example, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r480">480</a><a name="r480" id="r480"></a>]).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Contrasting  these experimental studies, theoretical studies using molecular water models show no extension of the interface beyond the ultra-thin external surface [<a  href="ref22.html#r2198" name="r2198" title="go to cited reference" id="r2198">2198</a>]. However, such studies do not explain the experimental results. For example, by measuring electrostatic forces, water shows an anomalously low dielectric constant (&asymp; 2) next to boron nitride (BN) surfaces. The depth of this (out-of-plane dielectric constant &asymp;  2) layer is about 0.75 nm (3 water layers), it remains anomalously small (out-of-plane dielectric constant  &lt; 20)  up to 20 nm and does not return to its bulk value (dielectric constant &asymp;  80) for &asymp; 500 nm  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3373">3373</a><a name="r3373" id="r3373"></a>]. Interestingly, where solid surfaces interact strongly with contacting liquids (including water but not exclusively so), there are non-negligible interfacial effects.  Shear flow infrared experiments can reveal these to extend  up to several millimeters  into the bulk [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2913">2913</a><a name="r2913" id="r2913"></a>]. Liquid flowing slowly over the wetting surfaces produces cooling due to  stretching, while frictional interactions produce heating at fast rates .</p>

    <p>Up till 2020, there was no generally accepted explanation for these experimental phenomena or  properties. However, below is a new explanation that is very simple, easily understood, and potentially very important in several related fields. </p>
    <h2><a name="prop" id="prop"></a>Proposal for the generation of osmotic pressure at aqueous interfaces</h2>
    <p> Wherever water is present in a solution, it may be considered  either <a href="colligative_properties.html#d" title="go for more details">'bound' or 'free'</a> (bulk), although there will be  transitional water between these states. When considering the colligative properties, 'water' is considered bound to any solute when it has a very low entropy compared with pure liquid water.  Such water is considered part of the solute and not part of the dissolving 'free' (bulk) water  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref11.html#r1064">1064</a><a name="r1064" id="r1064"></a>]. Pure liquid water consists of a <a title="go for the evidence" href="cluster_evidence.html#2phas">mixture</a> containing low-density water, extensively hydrogen-bonded structures, and higher-density water, consisting of a mixture of chains and smaller, less extensive clusters. The proportions of  'bound' or 'free' water in pure liquid water can vary; the strongly bound larger clusters  behave like 'bound' water. In bulk liquid water, the relative concentrations of the two aqueous forms are of no consequence as all the water behaves the same throughout.</p>

</p>
</figure>
    <p> Suppose volumes of the solution contain different proportions of strongly and weakly hydrogen-bonded water molecules (or even more simply that there is more extensive clustering present). In that case, these different volumes will show a difference concerning their <a href="water_activity.html" title="go for an explanation">water activity</a>, <a href="colligative_properties.html#a" title="go for an explanation">chemical potential</a>, and internal pressure. <a href="#h"><sup>h</sup></a><a name="bh" id="bh"></a> Usually, any such instantaneous differences in  the water activity and chemical potential between different volumes within the same mass of a liquid would rapidly cause  liquid movement from one to the other. In this manner, these different states equalize, so removing any potential differences. However, where surfaces instantaneously interact with the liquid water, the concentration of the more extensive hydrogen-bonded clusters differs from the bulk values with the surface interactions preventing the potential equalization between bulk and surface volumes    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3216" name="r3216" id="r3216">3216</a>]. When this occurs, the  surface water has a lower water activity and lower chemical potential than the bulk. This  lower chemical potential eads to differences in osmotic pressure and other colligative properties such as freezing point and 'opening' pressures (see above left). In contrast, volumes of water within hydrophobic clefts and pores (see above left) have higher activity than bulk water, whereby the water tends to vacate  the clefts, creating 'closing' pressures. This tendency has been shown in both hydrophobic  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3130">3130</a><a name="r3130" id="r3130"></a>] and hydrophilic [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3135">3135</a><a name="r3135" id="r3135"></a>] clefts. It has also been demonstrated that the  water cavitation within such pores may depend on the orientation of hydrophobic groups situated on the pore's rim. These can trigger the drying of nonpolar pockets in liquid water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3993">3993</a><a name="r3993" id="r3993"></a>].</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At hydrophilic surfaces,  interactions between the surface and neighboring water molecules establish the  localized hydrogen bonding. Together with steric factors, this increases  the cluster extent and lifetime [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2059">2059</a><a name="r2059" id="r2059"></a>].<a href="#b"><sup>b</sup></a><a name="bb" id="bb"></a> As the &lsquo;free&rsquo; water reduces   compared with its bulk value when the formation of longer-lived and more  extensive hydrogen-bonded clusters increases, the water  activity reduces, and the osmotic pressure increases. Solutes next to the  surface will move to equalize the water activity throughout the liquid. In  other words, the osmotic pressure generated next to the surface will displace  solutes from the surface towards the bulk until its effect compensates the  osmotic pressure of the surrounding solution or the system reaches a steady state. <a name="nernst" id="nernst"></a></p>

    <p>As the first effect of this solute expulsion is naturally the non-equilibrium formation  of an increased concentration band as expelled solute mixes with the initial  solute concentration, the extent of the expulsion will affect the whole of the  unstirred layer. The effect of the surface will decay exponentially out to the stirred bulk (the Nernst layer, &delta; &asymp;  1-100 &micro;m or more if unstirred pure water, see diagram right) with a thickness dependent on the cube root of the diffusivity of the solutes  [<a  href="ref27.html#r2699" name="r2699" title="go to cited reference" id="r2699">2699</a>]. <a href="#g"><sup>g</sup></a><a name="bg" id="bg"></a> The unstirred layer is  not stationary but is a region of slow laminar flow parallel to the surface where  transport is by diffusion rather than advection. The  thickness of the layer, &delta;, is less than the actual thickness but rather an operational thickness (see right) defined by the equivalent uniform concentration gradient. As the diffusion of hydrogen ions is several times greater than hydroxide ions, the unstirred layer becomes negatively charged with  developing charge separation.<a href="#i"><sup> i</sup></a><a name="bi" id="bi"></a> After a considerable time (much greater than minutes), dependent on the vessel size and shape, an equilibrium water activity will extend over the entire liquid up to the surface of the solid. The liquid structuring will not be constant over this volume.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Where hydrophilic microparticles or nanoparticles  are suspended in aqueous solutions, their surfaces will necessarily cause  mutually repulsive, non-equilibrium, osmotic pressure effects. These that may result in the ordering of  the particles for considerable  periods (much greater than minutes) within small volumes of the liquid [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref3.html#r272">272a</a><a name="r272" id="r272"></a>, <a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2060">2060</a><a name="r2060" id="r2060"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Note that the non-equilibrium osmotic drive does not require a material membrane to separate the two solutions  [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1744">1744</a><a name="r1744" id="r2"></a>], provided there are two <span style=" float:none; clear:both;">distinct volumes</span> (e.g.,  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1669">1669</a>]). Here the two phases consist  of the unstirred and stirred layers.  In this context [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1739">1739</a><a name="r1739" id="r1739"></a>], the affected aqueous layer behaves similarly to that described for the exclusion zone (<abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>) water by Pollack and forms a simple explanation of his experimental data  [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1740">1740</a>]. It also shows similarities with the experiments on autothixotropy [<a href="ref6.html#r509">509</a><a name="r509" id="r509"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1898">1898</a><a name="r1898" id="r1898"></a>, <a href="ref20.html#r1975">1975</a><a name="r1975" id="r1975"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    Other experimental properties of the <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> layers, such as the reduction in its  thickness with the  particle size causing the effect [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2062">2062</a><a name="r2062" id="r2062"></a>], and the effect of increased bulk <a href="water_dissociation.html#o">ionic strength</a> [<a href="ref14.html#r1328">1328b</a>], are easily explained by the presented hypothesis. The  unstirred layer around particles depends on the particle size and  high bulk osmotic pressures and will oppose the osmotic pressure at the hydrophilic  surface. An interesting alternative explanation of the EZ layers, using Nafion,<a href="#e"><sup>e</sup></a> involving diffusiophoresis, has been proposed   [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2808">2808</a><a name="r2808" id="r2808"></a>] but cannot explaini most of the cases of EZ-layer formation.

    <p>Another effect of interfaces is the formation of evanescent waves due to the internal reflection of electromagnetic radiation. The standing  electromagnetic evanescent wave within the interfacial water is caused by  impinging electromagnetic radiation and the angle at which total internal  reflection occurs (&theta;). The standing electromagnetic wave interacts with water molecules to stabilize a standing wave of hydrogen-bonded clusters (coherence, lower entropy).  In agreement with the experimental data [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1173">1173</a><a name="r1173" id="r1173"></a>,<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1589"> 1589</a><a name="r1589" id="r1589"></a>, <a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1741">1741</a><a name="r1741" id="r1741"></a>, <a  href="ref28.html#r2704" title="go to cited reference" >2704</a>], this alters the local concentration and extent of hydrogen-bonded clusters so increasing the above osmotic effect. The distance range affected is governed by the wavelength (&gt; 200 nm), whereby a coherent (or partially coherent) structure may emerge  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3712">3712</a><a name="r3712" id="r3712"></a>]. It has also been shown that infrared radiation increases the hydrogen-bonded interactions of water molecules in protein hydration shells [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref25.html#r2489">2489</a><a name="r2489" id="r2489"></a>]. Therefore, irradiation of the stretch vibration modes of the elongated water clusters  increases  the  size of the coherent (orderly, lower entropy) regions [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1691">1691</a><a name="r1691" id="r1691"></a>] of the water and their degree of coherence (orderliness, reduced entropy). It has been found that bulk water can be efficiently aligned by THz laser fields around 12 THz (400 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup>), matching the single molecule's reorientational time in the bulk phase at equilibrium  [<a href="ref35.html#r3489"  title="go to cited reference">3489</a><a name="r3489" id="r3489"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It appears that a similar effect on solutes to the one described for water may occur in other polar solvents that can form hydrogen bonds [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1742">1742</a><a name="r1742" id="r1742"></a>]; thus reinforcing the likelihood that the mechanism does not depend on any specific properties of water, such as the here-described colligative thermodynamics. Increasing <a href="aqueous_alcohol.html">ethanol to water</a> gives a maximum exclusion zone width at about 12 % v/v followed by a decrease to about half the pure water width at 95 % v/v ethanol     [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3145">3145</a><a name="r3145" id="r3145"></a>]. </p>

        <p>There is no <em>a priori</em> reason why the same phenomenon as described above should not also apply to gas/liquid interfaces. The surface of water differs from the bulk as the density decreases to zero in a complex manner. See left for the typical density at the surface, as shown by modeling studies.  There is much direct evidence for an effective depth of the liquid surface of many nanometers [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2751" >2751</a>]. In addition, the presence of  an extensive <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> layer (up to 4 mm at a flat surface) at the gas-liquid interface has been confirmed experimentally    [<a href="ref24.html#r2389">2389</a><a name="r2389" id="r2389"></a>]. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The generation of the osmotic pressure at the surface is  due partly to the necessarily under-coordinated water molecules at the gas-liquid  interface forming an ice-like, low-density phase [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2004">2004</a><a name="r2004" id="r2004"></a>] that has lower  water activity than the bulk water, and partly to the higher solute concentration formed just under the interface. In addition, the remaining hydrogen bonding in the surface is stronger  than in the bulk [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref13.html#r1261">1261</a><a name="r1261" id="r1261"></a>], due to the reduced competition from neighboring  water molecules, lower anti-cooperativity, and compensation for the increased  chemical potential on the loss of some bonding.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There is now much evidence  that sub-micron-sized gas-filled cavities (often called <a href="nanobubble.html" title="go to for more information">nanobubbles</a>) can exist  for a significant  time both in bulk aqueous solution and submerged aqueous-hydrophobe interfaces.  Their contained gas is in constant flux, with gas molecules both leaving and  entering continuously. The cavities are under excess pressure given by the  Laplace equation (2&gamma;/r, where &gamma; is the surface tension and r is the cavity  radius). The surface tension causes a tendency to minimize their surface  area and volume. Nanobubbles grow or shrink by diffusion according to external  pressure and the degree of over-saturation or under-saturation in the surrounding  solution, with the dissolved gas relative to the raised cavity pressure. As the  solubility of gas is proportional to the gas pressure, and this pressure is  exerted by the surface tension in inverse proportion to the size of the  bubbles, there is an increasing tendency for gases to dissolve as the bubbles  reduce in size. This accelerates the bubble-dissolution process. The bubble's movements and contractions  increase such size-reduction during this activity,  which aids the removal of any gas-saturated solution from around the cavities. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Present theoretical calculations show that nanobubbles should only persist for a few microseconds,  in contrast to their long lifetimes (hours to days) as detected experimentally by light  scattering, or resonant mass measurement  (bulk nanobubbles [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1972">1972</a><a name="r1972" id="r1972"></a>]), or  tapping mode atomic force microscopy  (surface nanobubbles).  Interestingly, these cavities (bubbles) are subject to <a href="Brownian.html" title="go for more information"   target="otherWin2" onclick="newWin('otherWin2')">Brownian motion</a>,  behaving as  though they have solid shells similar to solid nanoparticles. Furthermore, surface and  bulk-phase nanobubbles can both give rise to the otherwise difficult to explain <a title="go for more information" href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#long">long-range attraction between hydrophobic surfaces</a> due to bridging nanoscopic  gas cavities  or an osmotic effect due to local nanobubble  depletion. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A further reason for at least  some of the stability of nanobubbles is that the nanobubble gas/liquid  interface is <a href="interfacial_water.html" title="go for references" >charged</a> [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1591">1591</a><a name="r1591" id="r1591"></a>], expanding the surface and introducing an  opposing force to the surface tension, so slowing or preventing the nanobubble  dissipation. It is clear that the presence of  like charges at the interface will reduce the effect of the surface tension,  with charge repulsion acting in the opposite direction to the surface  minimization due to surface tension. Any effect may be  enhanced by the  presence of additional charged materials that favor the gas-liquid interface,  such as OH<sup>&minus;</sup> ions at neutral or basic pH [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1591">1591</a>]. It  has been proposed that the surface tension is reduced by the degree of  supersaturation at the surface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2013">2013</a><a name="r2013" id="r2013"></a>]. This supersaturation is  prevented from equilibrating away from the bubbles by the imposed osmotic  pressure, this introduces a further stabilization effect on the nanobubbles. </p>

        <p>Contributing to the  stability of nanobubbles is the slow rate of gas diffusion to the bulk liquid  surface from both surface and bulk-phase nanobubbles  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1973">1973</a><a name="r1973" id="r1973">, </a><a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1987">1987</a><a name="r1987" id="r1987"></a>]. In particular, nanobubbles in a cluster of bulk nanobubbles protect each other from diffusion by a shielding effect  [<a href="ref21.html#r2074">2074</a><a name="r2074" id="r2074"></a>].   A thick interfacial layer, a phenomenon  experimentally supported by the higher forces required to penetrate the nanobubbles' interface [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1986">1986</a><a name="r1986" id="r1986">, </a><a title="go to cited reference" href="ref20.html#r1987">1987</a>]. Note that the interface has extensive volumes on both sides where there is laminar flow orthogonal to the surface only. Here we assume that the  cause of this layer is the osmotic pressure produced by solutes [<a href="ref25.html#r2406">2406</a><a name="r2406" id="r2406"></a>] and water structuring beneath the gas-liquid  interface [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2057">2057</a><a name="r2057" id="r2057"></a>]. This is also the cause of the experimentally visible <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>-water layer    [<a href="ref24.html#r2389">2389</a>],  preventing the gas from dissolving towards the bulk and driving any dissolved gas near  the interface back into the nanobubble (see above left). The depth of the &lsquo;unstirred&rsquo; layer (&delta;) is approximately proportional to the size of the  nanobubbles due to their <a href="Brownian.html" title="go for more information">Brownian motion</a>. This thickness   reduces on mixing caused  by any surface changes in the bubbles as they rise or change size. A higher osmotic pressure around bubbles  has been suggested to explain why bubbles fail to coalesce, although its origin was unproven  [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref26.html#r2536">2536</a><a name="r2536" id="r2536"></a>].

    <p>Once the osmotic origin of the <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> water is accepted, other properties of the <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>-water are rationalized. It is interesting to hypothesize the effect of removing ions (including H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&minus;</sup>) from water within the exclusion zone due to the interfacial osmotic pressure. Ions would typically terminate hydrogen-bonding 'wires' within the aqueous milieu. The absence or reduction of such terminations allows  more extensive hydrogen bonding and consequent structuring of the low-density and high-density forms of water. This does not necessarily lead to a higher fraction of the low-density form, just that both such clusters will be more extensive and aligned. Such fiber-like structures have been found in <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>-water [<a  href="ref33.html#r3283" name="r3283" title="go to cited reference" id="r3283">3283</a>]. Also, the higher activity, denser, <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr> water would move preferably towards the low-activity surface as it possesses the higher water activity out of the water clusters present. As such, the water will have somewhat different properties,  explaining the experimentally found properties of <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>-water. Examples are the changed UV absorption that indicates altered structuring [<a href="ref14.html#r1328">1328a</a>], the higher refractive index indicating higher density [<a  href="ref28.html#r2793" name="r2793" title="go to cited reference" id="r2793">2793</a>], the higher viscosity indicating stronger hydrogen bonding, the slower diffusion indicating greater clustering [<a  href="ref28.html#r2792" title="go to cited reference" >2792c</a>], the lower spin-lattice relaxation times (T<sub>1</sub> ) indicating slower dynamics [<a  href="ref28.html#r2792" title="go to cited reference" >2792c</a>], the increased birefringence suggesting a  liquid-crystalline zone next to the surface, and the high permittivity indicating an unusual alignment of water dipoles [<a  href="ref28.html#r2792" title="go to cited reference" >2792b</a>].  As found in <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> water, the increase in density at the interface has been explained previously by the increase in clustering, causing the water to behave as though <a href="density_anomalies.html#Sdens" title="go for more explanation and evidence" >it is at a lower temperature</a>, which also explains the ease with which this <a href="hexagonal_ice.html#nuc"  title="go for more explanation and evidence">surface layer freezes</a>. The presence of 270-nm absorption in the interfacial water, as described for <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> water [<a  href="ref14.html#r1328" title="go to cited reference">1328</a>], has been ascribed to the <a href="h10o5_orbitals.html" title="go for more explanation and evidence">delocalization of electrons within the extended clustering,</a> particularly the presence of <a href="h10o5_orbitals.html">pentameric rings</a>.<a href="#d"><sup> d</sup></a><a name="bd" id="bd"></a> As the lowest unoccupied molecular-orbitals (<abbr title="Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital">LUMOs)</abbr> of the clusters are both huge and of relatively low energy, these electron delocalizations are stabilized by adding an electron but not a proton. This causes the charge separation seen at these interfaces [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1744">1744</a>, <a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2061">2061</a><a name="r2061" id="r2061"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the self-generation of colligative properties at hydrophilic interfaces is a simple explanation for the properties of the existing wide-ranging solvent interfaces. As such, it fulfills Occam's razor &quot;Plurality is not to be posited without necessity.&quot;</p>

                </strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Nafion<strong><sup>&reg;</sup></strong> (manufactured by DuPont) is a sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene-based fluoropolymer-copolymer [<a  href="ref19.html#r1880" name="r1880" title="go to cited reference" id="r1880">1880</a>] that strongly absorbs water   [<a  href="ref33.html#r3242" name="r3242" title="go to cited reference" id="r">3242</a>]. It has excellent chemical and electrochemical stability and high proton conductivity but  limited operating temperature (&lt; &asymp; 80&nbsp;&deg;C). Nafion<strong><sup>&reg;</sup></strong> has  hydrophilic side chains,  on a hydrophobic core, organized to form a network of interconnected channels and nanometric (2&ndash;6 nm) cavities. These  fill with water upon hydration and partially empty on dehydration,  enabling the water transport through the membrane and supporting excellent proton conduction.      Exposure of a Nafion<strong><sup>&reg;</sup></strong>117 membrane to elevated temperatures and pressures (up to 150&nbsp;&deg;C and 0.7 MPa) in  liquid water leads to  excessive swelling, substantial changes to its internal structure, and disruption of its conductive channel network   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3386">3386</a><a name="r3386" id="r3386"></a>]. Nafion has been extensively used in <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> (exclusion zone) experiments.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Although proposed to be stable in earlier experiments,  it has been proposed to produce a slowly separating colloidal crystal at its surface   [<a  href="ref24.html#r2388" name="r2388" title="go to cited reference" id="r2388">2388</a>], produces attached outgrowths of Nafion microfibers  [<a  href="ref24.html#r2388" title="go to cited reference" >2388d</a>], and release a large number of protons [<a  href="ref24.html#r2388" title="go to cited reference" >2388c</a>]. At higher temperatures, a proportion will dissolve in proportion to its swelling    [<a  href="ref33.html#r3243" name="r3243" title="go to cited reference" id="r3243">3243</a>]. If correct, this  may call into question much of the <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> work using this material and  confuse  the fundamental properties of the <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>, mainly as Nafion has been the material of choice in many studies as it shows a maximal and easily obtained <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr><abbr title="exclusion zone"></abbr>. However, work on <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> using other hydrophilic materials is not affected by this finding. In 2020 it was proposed that the EZ formation is due to the unwinding of polymer fibers into the liquid bulk   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4361">4361</a><a name="r4361" id="r4361"></a>]..</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Investigations into the water content of Nafion and other sulfonated polymers showed  strong relationships among the different types of water (strongly bound, weakly bound, and free) dependent on the charge density and distribution [<a  href="ref29.html#r2888" name="r2888" title="go to cited reference" id="r2888">2888</a>]. A model of the Nafion<strong><sup>&reg;</sup></strong> membrane, incorporating water content, activity-dependent diffusivity, and volume expansion have been used to resolve Nafion's water activity profiles  [<a  href="ref33.html#r3205" name="r3205" title="go to cited reference" id="r3205">3205</a>]. About 40&ndash;60% of water content remains unfrozen at &minus;70 &deg;C, starting from the center of the nanopores  and increasing gradually as the temperature decreases   [<a  href="ref43.html#r4250" name="r4250" title="go to cited reference" id="r4250">4250</a>]. This indicates a decrease in the water activity from the pore center to the polymer surface throughout Nafion<strong><sup>&reg;</sup></strong>.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The closely-related  proton-exchange membranes (disulfonated poly(arylene ether) and polyimide copolymer) have been discussed [<a  href="ref32.html#r3163" name="r3163" title="go to cited reference" id="r3163">3163</a>]. [<a href="#be">Back</a>]</p>

      <p><a name="g" id="g"></a><sup>g</sup> <strong>The Nernst layer.</strong> Walther Hermann Nernst, (1864 &ndash; 1941) was a German chemist who won the 1920 Nobel Prize in chemistry. The Nernst layer is a theoretical layer corresponding to the green line in the<a href="#nernst"> above Figure</a> which shows the concentration profile along the direction   perpendicular to a catalytic surface coinciding with the   tangent to the true concentration profile at the interface. The effective thickness &delta; of this diffusion layer is that it would have if   the concentration profile were a straight line coinciding with the   tangent to the correct concentration profile at the interface. That straight line is extended up   to the point where the bulk  is reached. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It is  impossible to stir  any solution right up to an interface. There is always an unstirred layer adjacent to the surface, usually extending  between 20 &mu; to 0.5 mm thick, even with stirring. Vigorous stirring will reduce this but still leave unstirred layers several &micro;m thick, dependent on the diffusivity. Excessive stirring has no further effect due to the bulk turbulence as there is always laminar flow at the surface. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong><a name="knud" id="knud"></a>The Knudsen layer.</strong> The Knudsen layer is a similar non-equilibrium unstirred layer (named after Martin  Knudsen, 1871 - 1949) on the gas side of the gas-liquid interface. The thickness of this layer is several times the mean free path of the mixture. The mean free path is proportional to the viscosity and the square root of the temperature, and inversely proportional to the pressure and the square root of the molecular mass of the mixture. At 20&nbsp;&deg;C and atmospheric pressure, the mean-free path of water vapor and dry air are 2.16 &micro;m and 0.07 &micro;m.
