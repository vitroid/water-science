      life exist without water?<sup> <a name="ba" id="ba"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="water_life.html#a"> a</a></sup></h2>
    <p>Water and life are closely linked. This has been recognized throughout history by civilizations and religions and is still the case with scientists today [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1011">1011</a><a name="r1011" id="r1011"></a>]. Liquid water is required for life to start<sup><a name="bc" id="bc"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="water_life.html#c"> c</a></sup> and for life to continue. No enzymes work in the absence of water molecules. No other liquid can replace water. We are very fortunate, therefore, that our planet is so well endowed. Water is a common material in the Universe, being found as widely dispersed gaseous molecules and as <a href="amorphous_ice.html">amorphous ice</a> in tiny grains and much larger asteroids, comets, and planets, but water needs particularly exacting conditions to exist as a liquid as it does on Earth. It is most likely that this water arrived from multiple sources, such as comets and asteroids, somewhat after solid planet Earth was formed [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1015">1015</a><a name="r1015" id="r1015"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The development of life required this water. How  this was achieved is a question that has interested many since well before the early experiments producing amino acids from simpler molecules by electric discharge in aqueous systems [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1016">1016</a><a name="r1016" id="r1016"></a>]. Subsequently, various theories have been propounded but without a consensus except for the critical involvement of liquid water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1017">1017</a><a name="r1017" id="r1017"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Water  possesses particular properties that  cannot be found in other materials and that are required for life-giving  processes (but see also [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1153">1153</a><a name="r1153" id="r1153"></a>]). These properties are brought about by the <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen-bonded  environment</a>, particularly evident in liquid water  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1423">1423</a><a name="r1423" id="r1423"></a>].  Hydrogen bonds are roughly tetrahedrally and arranged such that when strongly  formed the local clustering expands, decreasing the density. Such <a href="clusters_introduction.html">low-density  structuring</a> naturally occurs at low and supercooled temperatures and gives rise  to many physical and chemical properties that evidence the <a href="water_anomalies.html">particular  uniqueness of liquid water</a>. If aqueous hydrogen bonds were actually somewhat  stronger, then water would behave similar to a <a href="amorphous_ice.html#e" title="go for an explanation" >glass</a>, whereas if they were  weaker then water would be a gas and only exist as a liquid  at sub-zero temperatures.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The quantitative and  qualitative consequences of strengthening or weakening of the hydrogen bond in  water are considered here. If the hydrogen bond  strength was slightly different from its natural value, then there may be  considerable consequences for life. Water would not be liquid  on the surface of Earth at its average temperature if the hydrogen bonds were as little changed as 7%  stronger or 29% weaker. The <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#density">temperature of maximum density</a> naturally occurring  at about 4&nbsp;&deg;C would disappear if the hydrogen bonds were just 2% weaker. Significant  consequences for life are to be found if the hydrogen bonds did not have their  natural strength. Even very slight strengthening of the hydrogen bonds may have  substantial effects on normal metabolism. <a title="go to 'Water ionization' page"  href="water_dissociation.html">Water dissociation</a> becomes much less  evident if the hydrogen bonds are just a few percent stronger, but pure water contains  considerably more H<sup>+</sup> ions if they are few percent weaker. The  important alkali metal ions Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> lose <a href="intracellular_water.html">their  distinctive properties</a> if the hydrogen bonds are 11% stronger or 11% weaker,  respectively. Hydration of <a href="protein_hydration.html" title="more on protein hydration" >proteins</a> and <a href="nucleic_acid_hydration.html">nucleic acids </a>depends significantly on  the relative strength of the biomolecule-water interactions  compared with  the water-water hydrogen bond interactions. Stronger water hydrogen bonding  leads to water molecules clustering together and so not being available for  biomolecular hydration. Generally, the extended denatured  proteins become  more soluble in water if the hydrogen bonds become substantially stronger or  weaker. If the changes in this bonding are sufficient, present natural globular  proteins cannot exist in liquid water.

    <p>Intriguingly, liquid water acts in  subtly different manners as circumstances change, responding to variations in  the physical and molecular environments and occasionally acting as though it  were present as <a href="aqueous_biphasic.html">more than one liquid phase</a>. Sometimes liquid water is free-flowing,  while at other times, in other places or under subtly  different conditions, it acts more like a weak gel. Shifts in the hydrogen bond  strength may fix water&rsquo;s properties at one of these extremes to the detriment  of processes requiring the opposite character. Evolution has used the  present natural responsiveness and variety in the liquid water properties such  that it is now required for life as we know it. <a href="nucleic_acid_hydration.html">DNA</a> would not form helices able  to both zip and unzip without the present hydrogen bond strength. <a href="protein_hydration.html" title="more on protein hydration" >Enzymes</a> would  not possess their 3-D structure without it, nor would they retain the  controlled flexibility required for their biological action.  Compartmentalization of life&rsquo;s processes by using membranes with subtle  permeabilities would not be possible without water&rsquo;s intermediate hydrogen bond  strength. In liquid water, the balance between the  directional component of hydrogen bonding and the isotropic van der Waals  attractions is <a href="clusters_overview.html">finely poised</a>. Increased strength of the hydrogen bond directionality  gives rise to ordered clustering, with consequential effects on physical  parameters tending towards a glass-like state, whereas reducing its strength  reduces the size and cohesiveness of the clusters with the properties of water  then tending towards those of its isoelectronic neighbors methane and neon,  where only van der Waals attractions remain.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Quite small percentage changes in  the strength of the aqueous hydrogen bond may give rise to large percentage  changes in such physical properties as melting point, boiling point, density,  and viscosity. Some of these potential changes may  not significantly impinge on life&rsquo;s processes (<em>e.g., </em>compressibility or  the speed of sound), but others are of paramount importance. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although, in most cases,  weakening or strengthening of the  hydrogen bond strengths may cause contrary effects on the  physical properties, this is not always the case if the hydrogen bond strength  tends towards high or low extremes. </p>

On hydrogen bond weakening, they both decrease due to the reduced  water-surface or water-solute interactions. Strong hydrogen bonding eases the  formation of expanded cavities as evidenced in the <a href="clathrate_hydrates.html">clathrate ices</a>, and which  can accommodate small hydrophobic molecules, so increasing their solubility.  However, such small hydrophobic molecules will also be more easily dissolved  when weak hydrogen bonding allows more facile cavity formation to enable their  entry into solution.

    <h2><a name="est" id="est"></a>Estimating the effect of changes  in water hydrogen bond strength</h2>
    <p>Estimates of the physical consequences due to variations in the  hydrogen bond strength may vary from one method to another. However, the data above indicates that relatively small changes in hydrogen bond strength may have  some relatively large effects. Strengthening hydrogen bonding has particularly  important effects on<a title="go to find more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#Pvisc"> viscosity</a> and <a title="go to find more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#Tdiff">diffusion</a>, indicated by the large changes  occurring in supercooled water.<br />
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It is possible to investigate the effect that  changes in the hydrogen-bonding strength of water make in its properties by  examining the actual properties of water or other molecules with different  hydrogen bond strengths. However, different methods, materials or conditions  have weaknesses in their utility. The possibilities for examining the effects  of varying hydrogen bond strengths are:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Changing  the physical environment of water, such as temperature or pressure, and examining  the consequential changes in the physical parameters, if assumed solely due to  the variation in the hydrogen bond strength. However, varying the temperature  also changes the heat energy content, and some compensation may be required to  negate effects other than hydrogen bond strength changes, such as density  effects. Also, changing the pressure increases density and reduces hydrogen  bond lengths, which increases hydrogen bond strength, but also bends the bonds  so reducing their <a title="go to 'Water molecular structure' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html#e">tetrahedrality</a>. A simple way of assessing the average  hydrogen bond strength is the enthalpy of evaporation calculated from the  difference in the enthalpy of the liquid and gaseous phases [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r540">540</a><a name="r540" id="r540"></a>].</li>
      <li>Modeling  water as an equilibrium mixture of low-density and high-density clusters (for example, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r23">23</a><a name="r23" id="r23"></a>]) and  examining the consequences of hydrogen bond strength variation on the cluster  equilibrium with resultant effects on the physical properties. This concept has  been shown to explain qualitatively and quantitatively most anomalies of liquid  water. The free energy change for the equilibrium between dense and less dense  clusters is tiny due to <a href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html#h">compensation between enthalpic and entropic</a> effects. Just a small shift in the enthalpic component due to changes in  hydrogen bond energy may shift the equilibrium position decisively one way or the  other.</li>
      <li>Examine  the physical properties of the isoptomers of water, HDO or D<sub>2</sub>O. <a title="go to find more information"  href="material_anomalies.html#Isotope">These have  stronger hydrogen bonds</a> than H<sub>2</sub>O due to their  reduced van der Waals core consequent upon nuclear quantum effects. The  hydrogen bond strength differences met using this method are small.</li>
      <li>Examine  the physical properties of the hydrides of neighboring elements, NH<sub>3</sub>,  HF, or H<sub>2</sub>S, which possess differing hydrogen bond strengths. The  hydrogen bond strength differences encountered by this method are rather large.</li>
</ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the following discussion, the effects of varying hydrogen bond  strength on individual physical properties, and the consequences for life, are initially  independently discussed without regard to other changes that might also be  occurring at the same time, such as changes in the physical state of water.

    <h2><a name="eff" id="eff"></a>Effect of water hydrogen bond strength on  melting and boiling point</h2>
    <p>In ice, all water molecules participate in four  hydrogen bonds (two as donor and two as acceptor) and are held relatively  static. In liquid water, some of the weaker hydrogen bonds must be broken to  allow the molecules to move around. The considerable energy required for breaking these  bonds must be supplied during <a title="go to find more information"  href="phase_anomalies.html#Mpt">the melting process,</a> and only a relatively minor  amount of energy is reclaimed from the   volume change. The free energy change  (&Delta;G = &Delta;H - T&Delta;S) must be zero at phase changes such as the melting or  boiling points. As the temperature of liquid water decreases, the number of  hydrogen bonds increases and water's entropy decreases. Melting will only occur  when there is sufficient entropy change to compensate for the energy required  for the bond breaking. The low entropy (high organization) of liquid water  causes this melting point to be high. If the hydrogen bond strength (that is, enthalpy change) in water is raised,  then the melting point must rise for the free energy change to stay zero.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At the temperature of the phase  change, this free energy is zero, so on melting (solid <img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" /> liquid) &Delta;H<sub>m</sub> = T<sub>m</sub>&Delta;S<sub>m</sub> and <a title="go to find more information"  href="phase_anomalies.html#Bpt">on vaporization</a> (liquid <img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" /> gas) &Delta;H<sub>v</sub> = T<sub>v</sub>&Delta;S<sub>v</sub>. In order to calculate the  hydrogen bond strength, it is assumed that the entropy changes during the  phase changes remain constant with respect to the temperature range. The  enthalpy change required to equal the temperature times this entropy change is  regarded as the hydrogen bond strength required at the melting point. Thus, the  percentage increase in the hydrogen bond strength is given by 100 &#739; (T&Delta;H<sub>m</sub>/T<sub>m</sub> &ndash;&Delta;H<sub>T</sub>)/ &Delta;H<sub>T</sub>, where &Delta;H<sub>T</sub> is the bond enthalpy at  temperature T and &Delta;H<sub>m</sub> is the bond  enthalpy at its normal melting point T<sub>m</sub>.  There is considerable  hydrogen bonding in liquid water, resulting in high cohesion that prevents  water molecules from being easily released from the water's surface.  Consequentially, the vapor pressure is reduced, and water has a high boiling point.  Using a similar argument to that  used above for melting point, the percentage reductions in the hydrogen bond  strength that result in lower boiling points are given by 100 &#739; (T &Delta;H<sub>v</sub> /T<sub>v</sub> &ndash;&Delta;H<sub>T</sub>)/ &Delta;H<sub>T</sub>, where &Delta;H<sub>v</sub> is the bond enthalpy at its  normal boiling point T<sub>v</sub> under one-atmosphere pressure. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Opposite shows how the bond  strength increases affect the melting point and how bond strength decreases affect the boiling point. The resulting  relationship  shows that water would freeze at the average surface  temperature of Earth (15&nbsp;&deg;C) with a 7% strengthening in water&rsquo;s hydrogen bond, or  it would boil on a 29% weakening. At our body temperature (37&nbsp;&deg;C), the  strengthening required for freezing is 18%, and the weakening required to turn  water into steam is 22%. The melting and boiling points of other liquids show that these values  are reasonable. </p>
<div style=" float:none; clear:both;"></div>
    <p>D<sub>2</sub>O has a melting point almost 4&nbsp;&deg;C higher than H<sub>2</sub>O  with bond strength 2% higher, which values fit on the  above melting point line. Hydrogen sulfide, which does form hydrogen bonds with strong bases  but is poor proton donor, has a boiling point of -60&nbsp;&deg;C with intermolecular  interactions only 20% of that of water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1018">1018</a><a name="r1018" id="r1018"></a>]. Hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen cyanide both possess hydrogen  bond interactions slightly greater than 50% of that of water and boil at 20&nbsp;&deg;C  and 26&nbsp;&deg;C, respectively.

    <h2><a name="hb" id="hb"></a>Effect of hydrogen bond strength on the  temperature of maximum density</h2>
    <p>The <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#density">high density of liquid water</a> is due mainly to the  cohesive nature of the hydrogen-bonded network. This reduces the free volume  and ensures a relatively high density, compensating for the partial open nature  of the hydrogen-bonded network. It is usual for liquids to expand when heated  at all temperatures. However, at 4&nbsp;&deg;C, water expands on heating or cooling. The  density maximum is brought about by the opposing effects on an increase in temperature, causing (a) structural collapse of the tetrahedral clustering  evident at lower temperatures so increasing density, and (b) thermal expansion,  creating extra space between unbound molecules, so reducing density.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As expanses of water are cooled, stratification  of water occurs that depends on density. In freshwater lakes, the densest water  is that at about 4&nbsp;&deg;C. This water sinks to the bottom circulating its contained  oxygen and nutrients. Further cooling causes the surface temperature to drop  towards 0&nbsp;&deg;C but has no immediate effect on deep-water temperatures, which remain  at 4&nbsp;&deg;C. When the surface water reaches 0&nbsp;&deg;C, it may rapidly freeze, as only molecules  at the surface have to be cooled further. The ice forms an insulating layer  over the liquid water underneath and so slows down any further surface cooling.  The water at the bottom of ice-covered lakes remains at 4&nbsp;&deg;C throughout the winter  so preserving animal and plant life there. In spring the warming rays of the  sun melt the surface ice layer first. Seawater behaves differently as the salt  content lowers the temperature of maximum density below its freezing point and  the maximum density is no longer observed. As seawater density increases with  pressure, due to depth, convection only involves about the top hundred meters.  The majority of this must be cooled to the freezing point (-2&nbsp;&deg;C) before salt-water  surface ice may form. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There would be clear consequences for aquatic  life if the temperature of maximum density were not observed in freshwater lakes  and rivers. Cooling would result in most of the water being at 0&nbsp;&deg;C before ice  formation is initiated. Such changes in hydrogen bond strength would not  significantly affect the low density of ice, which would still float on water.  However, subsequent ice formation may give rise to slushy ice formation without  a well-formed insulating upper surface layer of ice. More ice would form,  however, due to the lack of  insulation, and this ice would take far longer  to thaw, as additionally more water would have to warm first. Much larger  volumes of the freshwater would thus be affected, and the greater ice formation  may more easily reach the bottom of shallow lakes. The resultant situation  would have both positive and negative consequences for the aquatic life. Any  remaining liquid surface would allow a favorable surface gas exchange, but there  would be less liquid water. The end result for life,  due to the loss of this density maximum, would  be  important but not overwhelmingly life-threatening, except for shallow lakes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The weakening of the hydrogen bond strength  required to remove the maximum density property may be estimated in several  ways. A 2% decrease in the hydrogen bond energy reduces the maximum density by  the 4&nbsp;&deg;C required. The decrease calculated from the cluster equilibrium  of Wilse Robinson [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r56">56</a><a name="r56" id="r56"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r409">409</a><a name="r409" id="r409"></a>], where the free energy  change between their proposed water clusters is zero close to 0&nbsp;&deg;C, also agrees  with this value. D<sub>2</sub>O has a raised temperature of maximum density (11.185&nbsp;&deg;C) due to its stronger hydrogen bonds. However, if  this bond strengthening is used as an estimate of that required to lower the  temperature of maximum density of H<sub>2</sub>O below 0&nbsp;&deg;C, this also requires a hydrogen bond energy weakening close to 2%.

    <h2><a name="kos" id="kos"></a>Effect of water hydrogen bond strength on  kosmotropes and chaotropes</h2>
    <p>Ions cause considerable changes to the structuring of water. The  difference in their effects depends on the relative strength of ion-water and  water-water interactions. <a href="kosmotropes_chaotropes.html" title="more on kosmotropes and chaotropes">Ionic chaotropes</a> are large  singly charged ions, with low charge density (for example, SCN<sup>&minus;</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>,  HSO<sub>4</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, I<sup>&minus;</sup>, Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>,  NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, Cs<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>,  (NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>C<sup>+</sup> (guanidinium), and (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup> (tetramethylammonium) ions) that exhibit weaker interactions with water than  water with itself and thus interfere little with the hydrogen-bonding of the  surrounding water. Small or multiply-charged ions, with high charge density,  are ionic kosmotropes (for example, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>, HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>,  Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, H<sup>+</sup>,  OH<sup>&minus;</sup>, and HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>). Ionic kosmotropes exhibit stronger  interactions with water molecules than water with itself and therefore are capable  of breaking water-water hydrogen bonds. If the water-water hydrogen bond  energy were to increase, the kosmotropic ions would become chaotropic, and if the  water-water hydrogen bond energy were to decrease, chaotropic ions would become  kosmotropic. At present, the biologically essential ions Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> lie on opposite sides of the chaotropic/kosmotropic divide,<a href="intracellular_water.html"> facilitating many  cellular functions</a> by virtue of their differences. If they both had similar  aqueous characteristics, cellular membrane function would have  evolved  differently, and it is difficult to suppose how this might occur with the present  natural availability of the ions.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The different characteristics of  the <a href="intracellular_water.html">intracellular and extracellular environments</a> manifest themselves  particularly in terms of restricted diffusion and a high concentration of  chaotropic inorganic ions and kosmotropic other solutes within the cells, both  of which encourage intracellular low-density water structuring. The difference  in concentration of the ions is particularly apparent between Na<sup>+</sup> (intracellular  10 mM, extracellular 150 mM) and K<sup>+</sup> (intracellular 159 mM,  extracellular 4 mM); Na<sup>+</sup> ions creating more broken hydrogen-bonding beyond  their inner hydration shell and preferring a high aqueous density whereas K<sup>+</sup> ions prefer a lower density aqueous environment. The interactions between water  and Na<sup>+</sup> are stronger than those between water molecules, which  are stronger than those between water and K<sup>+</sup> ions. </p>
    <p><br />
      The hydration enthalpies for Na<sup>+</sup> and  K<sup>+</sup> are known to be -413 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> and -331 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1019">1019</a><a name="r1019" id="r1019"></a>], straddling the <a href="kosmotropes_chaotropes.html" title="more on kosmotropes and chaotropes">kosmotrope/chaotrope</a> divide. Using the mildly chaotropic Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> ion,  with hydration enthalpy -363 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>, as a marker, the division  point between these ion types may be estimated as close to halfway between the  K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> hydration enthalpies (-372 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>).  The changes in the water hydrogen bond energy required to convert the chaotrope  K<sup>+</sup> to a kosmotrope is thus estimated as 331/372 = 11% weakening and  for converting the kosmotrope Na<sup>+</sup> to a chaotrope is 413/372 = 11% strengthening.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The consequences of  changes to the properties of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions in aqueous  environments are difficult to quantify but are undoubtedly far-reaching. No cation  could easily replace K<sup>+</sup> inside cells as the more  chaotropic alkali metal cations Rb<sup>+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup> are rare, and  NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is toxic and little different from K<sup>+</sup> as  a chaotrope. Although other ions could replace Na<sup>+</sup> as a cationic kosmotrope,  Li<sup>+</sup> is rare and divalent ions (for example, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) may cause other effects, such as chelation. Life as  we know it could not exist without the current balance between Na<sup>+</sup> and  K<sup>+</sup> ions. The weakening of hydrogen bond strength shifting K<sup>+</sup> to become chaotropic either would cause K<sup>+</sup> ions to remain outside  cells with consequences on the cell membrane potential or would cause  intracellular water to be too disorganized to support present intracellular  processes.

    <h2><a name="ion" id="ion"></a>Effect of water hydrogen bond strength on its dissociation</h2>
    <p>No amount of liquid water contains only H<sub>2</sub>O  molecules due to <a title="go to 'Water ionization' page"  href="water_dissociation.html">self-dissociation</a> producing hydroxide and hydrogen ions. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This  dissociation of water is followed by the utilization of further water molecules to  ease the movement of the ions throughout the liquid. Such functions are &nbsp;fundamental to  biological processes and do not arise to a significant extent in any  non-aqueous liquid except hydrogen fluoride. Aqueous dissociation depends on both  H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&minus;</sup> formation  and their physical separation to prevent the rapid reverse reaction reforming H<sub>2</sub>O. H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>&minus;</sup> formation is greater when the hydrogen bonds are strongest whereas ionic  separation requires the hydrogen bond networks connecting the ions to be weak to prevent the ions from reforming water.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Thus, both strong and weak hydrogen  bonding leads to lesser dissociation (see opposite showing the variation of the pK<sub>w</sub> (= -Log10(K<sub>w</sub>))  with the hydrogen bond strength of water).  The data is calculated from the <a href="http://www.iapws.org/relguide/Ionization.pdf" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin9" onclick="newWin('otherWin9')">variation with temperature of the  pK<sub>w</sub></a> and enthalpy of vaporization. Water at 25&nbsp;&deg;C has a pK<sub>w</sub> of  about 14, as indicated on the right-hand side of the graph. Changes in hydrogen  bond strength between water molecules alter its degree of dissociation.</p>
<div style=" float:none; clear:both;"></div>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Strengthened hydrogen-bonding increases the (<a  href="grotthuss.html" name="Grotthuss" title="go for more information" id="Grotthuss">Grotthuss</a>) rate of  transfer of these ions in electrical fields but slows down their diffusion  otherwise. The acid strength of biomolecular groups is determined by the  competition between the biomolecules and water molecules for the hydrogen ions.  The strength by which the water molecules hold on to the hydrogen ion depends  on their hydrogen-bonding strength as a distributor of the charge. Biomolecular  ionization, therefore, also depends on hydrogen bond strength. Since all  biological processes are dependent on the charge, an entirely new evolutionary  perspective is required if water dissociation is suppressed by water hydrogen  bond strengthening. At intermediate hydrogen bond strength, dissociation  increases, reducing the pH of neutral solutions. The acidity (pK<sub>a</sub>) of  biomolecular groups, such as phosphate, also shows complex behavior with  decreasing water hydrogen bond strength and <a title="go to find more information"  href="material_anomalies.html#pka">often produces a p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> minimum</a>. Here,  there are opposite effects of (a) reduced dielectric, at lower hydrogen bond  strength, reducing ionic separation so tending to increase the p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> and (b) increased  water reactivity, also at lower hydrogen bond strength, increasing hydration  effects and enabling the dissociation, so tending to reduce the p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>.

    <p>Water is critical, not only for the <a href="protein_hydration.html" title="more on protein hydration" >correct folding of proteins</a> but also  for the maintenance of this structure. The free energy change on folding or  unfolding is due to the combined effects of both protein folding/unfolding and  hydration changes. Contributing enthalpy and entropy terms may, however,  individually be greater than the equivalent of twenty hydrogen bonds but such  changes compensate each other, leaving a free energy of stability for a typical  protein as just equivalent to one or two hydrogen bonds. There are both  enthalpic and entropic contributions to this free energy that change with  temperature and so give rise to the range of stability for proteins between their  hot and cold denaturation temperatures.</p>

This is due to the polar groups creating their own  ordered water, which generates a negative enthalpy change due to the increased  molecular interactions. Balanced against this is the positive enthalpy change  as the pre-existing water structure and the polar interactions within the  protein both have to be broken. As water naturally has more structure at lower  temperatures, the breakdown of the water structure makes a greater positive  contribution to the overall enthalpy at lower temperatures. Any weakening of  water&rsquo;s hydrogen bonds reduces the enthalpy of transfer of polar groups at all  temperatures as less energy is required to break down water&rsquo;s structure.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In contrast, the enthalpy of transfer of  nonpolar groups from the protein interior into water is negative below about  25&nbsp;&deg;C and positive above [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r150">150</a>]. At lower temperatures, nonpolar groups enhance pre-existing  order such as the clathrate-related structures [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref3.html#r270">270</a><a name="r270" id="r270"></a>], generating stabilization  energy. However, this effect is lost with increasing temperature, as any pre-existing  order is also lost. At higher temperatures, the creation of these clathrate  structures requires an enthalpic input. Thus, there is an overall positive  enthalpy of unfolding at higher temperatures. An equivalent but alternative way  of describing this process is that at lower temperatures, the clathrate-type  structure optimizes multiple van der Waals molecular interactions, whereas at  higher temperatures, such favorable structuring is no longer available. The  extent of these enthalpy changes with temperature is reduced if water&rsquo;s  hydrogen bonds are weakened, as the enthalpy change is raised at low  temperatures and decreased at higher temperatures.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At ambient temperature, the entropies of  hydration of both nonpolar and polar groups are negative [<a name="r151" id="r151"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r151">151</a>], indicating that both  create order in the aqueous environment. However, these entropies differ to how they change with increasing temperature. The entropy of  hydration of nonpolar groups increases through zero with increasing  temperature, indicating that they are less able to order the water at higher  temperatures and may, indeed, contribute to its disorder by interfering with  the extent of the hydrogen-bonded network. Also, there is an entropy gain from  the greater freedom of the nonpolar groups when the protein is unfolded. In  contrast, the entropy of hydration of polar groups decreases, becoming more  negative with increasing temperature, as they can create ordered  hydration shells even from the more disordered water that exists at higher  temperatures. Any weakening of water&rsquo;s hydrogen bonds raises the entropic cost due  to polar group hydration, as there is less natural order in the water to be  lost.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Overall, protein stability depends on the  balance between these enthalpic and entropic changes. For globular proteins,  the free energy of unfolding is commonly found to be positive between about 0&nbsp;&deg;C  and 45&nbsp;&deg;C. It decreases through zero when the temperature becomes either hotter  or colder, with the thermodynamic consequences of <a href="protein_denatured.html#denat">both cold and heat  denaturation</a>. The hydration of the internal nonpolar groups is mainly  responsible for cold denaturation as their energy of hydration (that is, -<img src="images/dh.gif" width="33" height="24" align="absmiddle" alt="Enthalpy change from native to denatured states " />) is greatest when cold. Thus, it is the  increased natural structuring of water at lower temperatures that causes cold  destabilization of proteins in solution. Heat denaturation is primarily due to  the increased entropic effects of the nonpolar residues in the unfolded state.  The temperature range for the correct folding of proteins (<img src="images/dg.gif" width="34" height="24" align="absmiddle" alt="Gibbs free energy change from native to denatured states " />&nbsp;<a title="click for an explanation" href="water_life.html#dg">above</a>) shifts  towards lower temperatures if water&rsquo;s hydrogen bonds are weaker and towards higher  temperatures if they are stronger. Typically, if the strength of the hydrogen  bond increased equivalent to the difference in strength between 0&nbsp;&deg;C and 100&nbsp;&deg;C (that is, raised cold denaturation) or  decreased equivalent to the difference in strength between 45&nbsp;&deg;C and 0&nbsp;&deg;C (that is, lowered heat denaturation) then  present proteins would not be stable in aqueous solution. The shifts required  may be calculated from the enthalpy and entropy of water to be a 51% increase  or an 18% weakening of water&rsquo;s hydrogen bond strength. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As the degree of interaction between water  molecules and biological molecules and structures depends on a competition for  the water&rsquo;s hydrogen bonding between the molecules and water itself, such  processes would change on varying the water-water hydrogen bond strength.  Increasing strength causes water to primarily bond with itself and not be  available for the hydrating structuring of proteins or DNA or for dissolving  ions. On the other hand, if the water-water hydrogen bond strength reduces, then  the information exchange mechanisms operating within the cell, such as hydrogen-bonded  water chains within and between proteins and DNA, will become non-operational.  Evolutionary pressures might be expected to compensate for only some of these  effects.

    <h2><a name="phys" id="phys"></a>Effect of water hydrogen bond strength on its other physical properties</h2>
    <p>Changes in water&rsquo;s hydrogen bond strength are expected to affect many of  water&rsquo;s physical properties (<a title="click for an explanation" href="water_life.html#fig">as above</a>). Some of these alterations only  make insignificant changes to whether water can act as the medium for life.  Pressure-dependent properties such as <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#Tcomp">compressibility</a> have unimportant consequences  as we live under relatively constant pressure. Some physical properties such as  the <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#sound">speed of sound</a> or <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#refract">refractive index</a> impinge little on life&rsquo;s processes. Other  physical properties change relatively slightly, such as <a title="go to find more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#ST">surface tension</a>, but even   small changes may affect some processes. Without strong hydrogen bonding,  there would not be the cohesion necessary for trees to manage to transport  water to their tops. <a title="go to find more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#Visc">Viscosity </a>is  particularly affected by the strengthening of water&rsquo;s hydrogen bonds, increasing  ten-fold from the value at 37&nbsp;&deg;C for an increase in the hydrogen bond strength of  only 8%. An alternative calculation using the Wilse Robinson equilibrium model [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r69">69</a><a name="r69" id="r69"></a>] gives the higher value  of 30% hydrogen bond strengthening required to shift the equilibrium  temperature sufficient to achieve this viscosity alteration. However,  comparing the data from D<sub>2</sub>O shows a 23% increase in viscosity at  25&nbsp;&deg;C, or 34% at 0&nbsp;&deg;C, for only a 2% increase in hydrogen bond strength showing  the major effect of hydrogen bonding on the viscosity. As diffusivity varies  inversely with viscosity, molecular movements slow down as viscosity increases.  This would be expected to have consequences for the speed with which life  processes could proceed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although D<sub>2</sub>O only has 2-3% stronger  hydrogen bonds than H<sub>2</sub>O as calculated from their enthalpy of  evaporation, it has crucial effects on mitosis and membrane function. In most  organisms it is toxic, causing death at high concentrations. It may be assumed,  however that life generally could adapt to its use, as found for some  microorganisms.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>The  solubility of gaseous oxygen and carbon dioxide are important features of  life&rsquo;s processes. In particular, the solubilities increase steeply as the hydrogen  bond strength increases from its natural value (see opposite for the dependence of the solubility of oxygen ([<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1020">1020</a><a name="r1020" id="r1020"></a>], at atmospheric pressure  and composition) on water&rsquo;s hydrogen bond strength (ambient conditions are indicated).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Carbon dioxide  solubility shows greater sensitivity due to the complex equilibria involved.  However, it has an even steeper rise in solubility at high  hydrogen bond strengths than oxygen; showing a four-fold increase (using  data from [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1021">1021</a><a name="r1021" id="r1021"></a>]) for a 5% hydrogen bond strengthening at 37&nbsp;&deg;C. The  full consequences of these changes are complex and challenging to assess. Oxygen  concentrations cannot be lowered below the threshold necessary for complex  circulatory life (&asymp; 0.1 mM, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1022">1022</a><a name="r1022" id="r1022"></a>]). With higher oxygen solubility, circulatory animals would be  capable of being larger, but more efficient anti-oxidant detoxification pathways  would be necessary. Nevertheless, it is likely that life could adapt to these  changes.</p>

    <p><a href="supercooled_water.html">Supercooled wate</a>r with differing hydrogen bond strengths has  been investigated using molecular dynamics with the <a href="water_models.html">TIP4P/2005 model</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4365">4365</a><a name="r4365" id="r"></a>].  The results show a high-temperature dependence near the<a href="amorphous_ice.html#super"> liquid-liquid critical  point</a> resulting from a rapid conversion from high-density liquid-like  environments with faster dynamics to low-density liquid-like ones with slower  dynamics.    </p>

    <h2><a name="conc" id="conc"></a>Conclusions</h2>
    <p>The major effects of changes to water&rsquo;s  hydrogen bond strength are summarized below, where they are considered individually. Small  changes of a few percent would not be threatening to life in general, but  changes over 10% (equivalent to just 2 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>) may cause a  significant threat. The overall conclusion to be drawn   is that water&rsquo;s hydrogen bond strength is poised centrally within a narrow  window of its suitability for life.</p>
