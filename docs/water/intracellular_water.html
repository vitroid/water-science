    <h2><a name="trans" id="trans"></a>Water transfer across membranes</h2>
    <p>How does water cross the <a href="membrane_hydration.html">membranes</a> that form hydrophobic barriers between aqueous compartments? The answer lies in <a href="diffusion.html">diffusion</a> and <a href="osmotic_pressure.html">osmosis</a>  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4113">4113</a><a name="r4113" id="r4113"></a>]. Under 'normal' conditions, the water content of a cell is maintained near-constant. Water diffusion across a cell membrane occurs either by the slow   partition process into the lipid bilayers, somewhat enabled by membrane protein, followed by its escape from the other side, or via a faster process involving aquaporins (water-permeable trans-membrane proteins)  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4114">4114</a><a name="r4114" id="r4114"></a>]. Also, transport of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> and other ions and osmolytes are accompanied by the movement of water into and out of the cell. There will generally be water movement in both directions across lipid membranes, but any net water movement is powered by osmosis. The activation energy of  water exchange through yeast plasma membranes is about that of a single water-water hydrogen bond, indicating the amount of the water structure that must be lost during its movement across the membranes   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4115">4115</a><a name="r4115" id="r4115"></a>]. High water permeabilities are found in renal proximal-tubule and red blood cells. Low water permeability is found where there are no aquaporins and with the membrane rich in water-blocking cholesterol molecules.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Natural physiological cell death (apoptosis) involves cell shrinkage with K<sup>+</sup> ion loss, whereas accidental cell death (necrosis) causes swelling with water gain, eventually resulting in cell lysis [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4178">4178</a><a name="r4178" id="r4178"></a>].</p>

The interior of the mammalian cell is a very crowded environment containing &asymp; 250 mg &#739; mL<sup>&minus;1</sup> protein, &asymp; 110 mg &#739; mL<sup>&minus;1</sup> RNA,   &asymp; 10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>2</sup> &#739; L<sup>&minus;1</sup> cytoskeleton: surface,  &asymp; 250 mM ions, and many other solutes. Consequently, the internal osmotic pressure is high, and the water activity is low. Most water is associated with these structures and there is relatively little 'free' bulk-like water. Crowding affects molecular diffusion    conformation, dynamics and kinetics [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3426">3426</a><a name="r3426" id="r3426"></a>], and the properties of the aqueous environment [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3175">3175</a><a name="r3175" id="r3175"></a>]; with viscosity ~10<sup>6</sup> times higher than bulk water and diffusion ~10<sup>6</sup> times lower than bulk water. Intracellular water is necessarily different from extracellular water  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3006">3006</a><a name="r3006" id="r3006"></a>]. Aggregation is prevented by the mostly negative charge of the solutes (e.g., proteins)  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3941">3941</a><a name="r3941" id="r3941"></a>]. There are also differences between sub-cellular compartments, such as  the cytoplasm and nucleus [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3942">3942</a><a name="r3942" id="r3942"></a>]. Cells contain differing amounts of water; dependent 
      more on their purpose (and hence expressed proteins) rather 
      than their source organism (for example, the % water contents 
      of red blood cells are about 64% whether from man or dog whereas 
      frog heart contains 80% but a frog egg only 49% water) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r762">762</a><a name="r762" id="r762"></a>]. Intracellular water is in a more ordered state
      (coherent.    [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3714">3714</a><a name="r3714" id="r3714"></a>]) than pure water, as demonstrated by its significantly shorter (<a title="go for more information" href="water_methods.html#nmr">NMR</a>) spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2321">2321</a><a name="r2321" id="r2321"></a>]. Very little of this water can be considered as solely a medium [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2753">2753</a><a name="r2753" id="r2753"></a>] <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#g">g</a><a name="bg" id="bg"></a></sup> but is a metabolic reactant, product, catalyst, chaperone, messenger, and controller (see, for example, [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref12.html#r1194">1194</a><a name="r1194" id="r1194"></a>]). Intracellular water cannot be pressed out of the cell even at 100 MPa and is likely to consist of  organized nanoscale water channels rather than a homogeneous gel-like cytoplasm [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3633">3633</a><a name="r3633" id="r3633"></a>]; the compressed water preferring to be absorbed into the protein structures.</p>

    <p align="left">Intracellular water is responsible for the conformations and functions of all biomolecules through direct interaction with their hydration shells  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref29.html#r2845">2845</a><a name="r2845" id="r2845"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2921">2921</a><a name="r2921" id="r2921"></a>]. However and importantly, the water's structuring may also be controlled by some cellular constituents. Cellular macromolecules &lsquo;&lsquo;dance&rsquo;&rsquo; to the tune of intracellular water and, to a more limited extent, <em>vice versa</em>. Water forms an integral part of biomolecular structures and functions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2949">2949</a><a name="r2949" id="r2949"></a>]. The water is essential for biomolecular recognition   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1787">1787</a><a name="r1787" id="r1787"></a>] and orchestrates the cell machinery   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1785">1785</a><a name="r1785" id="r1785"></a>]. The complexity and organization within the cytoplasm are expressed in a
      comprehensive review of intracellular water  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1191">1191</a><a name="r1191" id="r1191"></a>].

A key feature of intracellular water is its ability to convert between high and low-density states [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1364">1364</a><a name="r1364" id="r1364"></a>] (as exemplified by the <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="click for an explanation" href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr><a title="click for an explanation" href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#Fig2"><img border="0" src="images/rarrow.gif" width="20" height="12"  alt="reversible arrow" /></a><abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="click for an explanation" href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr><a title="click for an explanation" href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#Fig2"> equilibrium</a>).

The  extent of intracellular hydrogen bonding can be determined using an amphipathic  fluorescent nanodot. This shows time-dependent imaging contrasts due to the  different hydrogen bonding extents of the intracellular water. The nanodot&rsquo;s  amphiphilic nature in different local hydrogen-bonding environments produces  contrast images in lifetime and directly monitors the extent of the hydrogen-bonding  networks [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref36.html#r3512">3512</a><a name="r3512" id="r3512"></a>]. The assessment of the cellular state in live tissues has been established by <a href="water_methods.html#diel">microwave dielectric spectroscopy</a> (MDS) in determining the hydration state of the intracellular environment of live <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> nematodes.

      the commonly practiced <em>in vitro</em> experiments on the

      misleading. For example, CO<sub>2</sub> production in metabolizing cells may give rise to complex changes in water movement and osmotic pressure changes as neutral CO<sub>2</sub> diffuses readily but ions formed from it on hydration do not [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1137">1137</a><a name="r1137" id="r1137"></a>], and actively metabolizing cells may be producing a significant amount of their intracellular water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1139">1139</a><a name="r1139" id="r1139"></a>].

On this

      solutes encourage low-density water structuring. The difference 
      in concentration of the ions is particularly apparent between 
      Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> (see below); Na<sup>+</sup> ions (2.38 &Agrave; distant from water O-atoms. [<a href="ref39.html#r3868" name="r3868" title="go to cited reference" id="r3868">3868</a>] ) creating more broken hydrogen-bonding and preferring 
      a high aqueous density whereas K<sup>+</sup> ions (2.76 &Agrave; distant from water O-atoms [<a href="ref39.html#r3868" title="go to cited reference">3868</a>]) prefer a 
      low-density aqueous environment [<a href="ref38.html#r3796" name="r3796" title="go to cited reference" id="r3796">3796</a>]. A 1000-fold preference for

      reduced intracellular water mobility [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r817">817</a><a name="r817" id="r817"></a>]. 
      As explained in the discussion of the <a title="go to find more on ionic effects" href="hofmeister_series.html">Hofmeister 
      effect</a>, and shown by the negative ionic volumes 
      (that is, the addition of the ions reduces the volume of 
      the water, see below), the interactions between water and 
      Na<sup>+</sup> are stronger than those between water molecules, 
      which in turn are stronger than those between water and K<sup>+</sup> ions. Thus, water may be stripped more easily from the K<sup>+</sup> ions, and K<sup>+</sup> maintains the solubility of cell components in which carboxylate and phosphate are the principal anions [<a href="ref38.html#r3796"  title="go to cited reference" >3796</a>].The  differences in surface charge density may explain these comparisons.  The interaction strength is reflected in that the distances between the Na<sup>+</sup> ions and water are shorter than  between pairs of water molecules which are shorter than those between K<sup>+</sup> ions and water. Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions have even stronger destructive 
      effects on the hydrogen bonding than Na<sup>+</sup> ions. 
      K<sup>+</sup> ions are preferred within the intracellular 
      environment and are, after water, the second most abundant component of the cell by number [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref40.html#r3992">3992</a>]</p>

      <h2><a name="prot" id="prot"></a>The effect of intracellular protein on water structuring</h2>
      <p>The degree of density lowering inside cells is determined by the 
        solutes, their concentration and the conformations and state 
        of motion of the proteins; mobile proteins creating more disorder 
        in the clustering compared with more static proteins. Many 
        intracellular proteins are globular, so retaining rotational 
        entropy notwithstanding the crowded environment. Water has 
        conflicting effects in the mixed environments around proteins. 
        Weak hydrogen bonding between the protein and water molecules allows 
        greater flexibility and strong hydrogen-bonding endows the protein with 
        greater stability and solubility. There is an ordered structure 
        in the first shell around the protein, with both hydrophobic clathrate-like 
        and hydrogen-bonded water molecules helping the other  optimize 
        water's hydrogen-bonding network. Changes in the proteins' conformations 
        may result in water influx into the cell or efflux from the 
        cell [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r949">949</a><a name="r949" id="r949"></a>] 
        and density changes. Protein carboxylate groups are 
        generally surrounded by strongly hydrogen-bonded water, whereas 
        the water surrounding basic chaotropic groups (arginine, histidine, 
        and lysine) tends towards a clathrate structuring. Clathrate 
        formation over hydrophobic areas maximizes non-bonded interactions 
        without loss of hydrogen bonds, whereas carboxylate groups usually 
        only fit a collapsed water structure creating a reactive fluid 
        zone. The diffusional movement of the proteins will cause 
        changes in the water structuring outside the first hydration 
        shell.</p>

      <p>Half the hydrogen bonds are ruptured at the breaking surface, creating a zone of higher density water (as <a href="clusters_overview.html">explained

        close and surrounding high-density water zone with many broken

      <h2><a name="mob" id="mob"></a>The importance of protein mobility</h2>
      <p>Actin is a highly conserved and widespread eukaryotic protein 
        (42-43 kDa)<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#e"> e</a><a name="be" id="be"></a></sup> responsible for many functions in cells. Non-muscle 
        cells contain 5-10% (of all protein) actin, whereas muscle 
        cells contain about 20%. All actin molecules contain a 
        conserved acidic N-terminus with several neighboring aspartic 
        or glutamic acids (emphasized right) and a post-translation acetylated 
        terminal amino group (for example, N-Ace-Asp-Glu-Asp-Glu 
        in rabbit muscle &alpha;-actin). 
        When actin forms a filament structure, this highly charged 
        grouping is placed on the outer exposed edge of the helix, 
        where it may be additionally used as a binding site for 
        other proteins, such as myosin. The positionings of the 
        acidic N-terminal antennae are shown in red in the cartoon 
        below. Tubulin and the intermediate filaments are further structural proteins that form 
        immobile structures with ordered hydration within 
        cells, possessing conserved acidic  
        groupings that serve similar functions.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#e"> e</a></sup></p>

      forming 'stretched' confined water that is much more highly structured 
      (hence lower density) than the bulk water.</p>

    <p>As  overlapping fields from nearby groups enhance counter-ion association,  F-actin's extensive negatively charged N-terminus causes the partitioning of  cations into its vicinity, similar to that well known from i<a href="enztech/partition.html">immobilized

      shown by Kern [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r638">638</a><a name="r638" id="r638"></a>], who established that the activity of Na<sup>+</sup> with isobutyric 
      acid is &gt;0.9, whereas similarly with polyacrylate, it is &lt;0.32, 
      thus proving the more significant partitioning of cations within the 
    microenvironment of the multiply-charged polymer.</p>
    <div style=" float:none; clear:both;"><p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions behave differently 
        when close to the carboxylate groups; K<sup>+</sup> ions prefer forming ion pairs whereas Na<sup>+</sup> ions form 
        solvent separated pairings [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r637">637</a><a name="r637" id="r637"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2035">2035</a><a name="r2035" id="r2035"></a>]. This is due to the Na<sup>+</sup> ions holding on to their water 
        strongly. The inner shell polarized water molecules are ideally 
        situated for forming strong hydrogen bonds to the carboxylate oxygen 
        atoms. The K<sup>+</sup> ions prefer an inner shell clathrate water 
        structuring that is reinforced by its direct ion-pairing to the carboxylate 
        group. Also, Na<sup>+</sup> ions cannot participate in clathrate structuring, 
        whereas K<sup>+</sup> prefers this environment [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r641">641</a><a name="r641" id="r641"></a>]. 
        As the distance between the neighboring amino acid carboxylate groups 
        (about 7.3 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>) is about the same as the diameter of clathrate 
        water clusters (about 7.6 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>), extensive ion-pairing of the 
        adjacent carboxylate groups may be accommodated by neighboring clathrate 
        clustering. K<sup>+</sup> RCO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> pairs move 
        from solvent separated to ion-pair with the reduction in the p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>. 
        K<sup>+</sup> ions prefer strong acids (that is, low p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>), 
        whereas Na<sup>+</sup> prefers weak acids (that is, higher p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>). Direct ion-pair association discourages aqueous 
        hydrogen bonding to the carboxylate oxygen atoms but encourages 
        clathrate formation surrounding the ion-paired carboxylate group.</p>

      for the molecular mechanism of the association, including (1) the

    <p>Under conditions when the carboxylate groups possess high p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>, both K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> form solvent 
      separated species when partitioned into the carboxylate environment. 
      This gives a preference for Na<sup>+</sup> and high-density 
      water. However, rotation of the protein will  sweep such 
      ions and their associated water away. If the protein stops 
      rotating, Na<sup>+</sup> ions tend to destroy any low-density 
      structuring around carboxylate groups of the protein. However, 
      the intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> ion concentration 
      is usually far lower than that of K<sup>+</sup> ions (see above). At 
      low p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub>, K<sup>+</sup> ion pairs to carboxylate groups, 
      particularly when partitioned into their microenvironment due 
      to the presence of several contiguous acidic amino acids. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This hypothesis is compatible with the view that the water on either side of a membrane is different, and this encourages the differences in  K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3006">3006</a>].</p>

      <p>When the static protein filaments convert to freely diffusing

      <p>Eukaryotic tubulin is another structural protein that forms 
      immobile structures with ordered hydration 
      within 
      cells [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref7.html#r689">689</a><a name="r689" id="r689"></a>]. It  forms fat hollow and stiff microtubules (&asymp; 25 nm in diameter, containing low-density water), making tracks through  the intracellular space for the movement of organelles. These tubular structures  are built up from pairs of similar subunits (&alpha;  and &beta;), each of about 450 amino acids [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1140">1140</a><a name="r1140" id="r1140"></a>].
      
      Tubulins have a GTP binding domain near their N-terminal and two separate &beta;-sheets each surrounded by &alpha;-helices.  The microtubules are formed from head to tail arrangement of &alpha;/ &beta; dimers  with the beta-subunit GTP at the open end. Only this GTP is hydrolyzed  following polymerization. Outside the molecular core, two exterior anti-parallel &alpha;-helices lead to highly acidic C-termini, which are  thus situated outside of the microtubule and away from the tubulin surface [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref14.html#r1306">1306</a><a name="r1306" id="r1306"></a>]. The &alpha;-tubulin  structure is highly conserved with C-terminal consensus sequence - A- R- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">D</span>- M- A- A- L- <span class="style7">E</span>- K- <span class="style7">D</span>- Y- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- V- G- V- <span class="style7">D</span>- S- V-   followed by an extremely variable but highly acidic C- terminus exemplified by the human  &alpha;- tubulin (type &lsquo;ubiquitous&rsquo;) structure - <span class="style7">E</span>- G- <span class="style7">E</span>- G- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- G- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- COOH.  The &beta;- tubulin structure is also highly conserved with  C- terminal consensus sequence - A- <span class="style7">E</span>- S- N- M- N- <span class="style7">D</span>- L- V- S- <span class="style7">E</span>- Y- Q- Q- Y- Q- <span class="style7">D</span>- A- T- A-   followed by an extremely variable highly acidic C- terminus exemplified by the human  &beta;- tubulin (type &lsquo;4Q&rsquo;) structure  - <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">D</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- Y- A- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- <span class="style7">E</span>- V- COOH. As with the actins, these examples indicate   that very strongly conserved structures exist for tubulins except for at  an end (here the C-terminus) where glutamic acid and aspartic acid occur   interchangeably and in variable but always very acidic  sub-structures. Improper functioning of tubulin has been linked with  intracellular water clustering in the origin of cancer [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref20.html#r1901">1901</a><a name="r1901" id="r1901"></a>].

      <p>Intermediate  filaments are fibrous, flexible, and elastic proteins formed mainly from coiled  coils (&lsquo;ropes&rsquo;, &asymp; 11 nm diameter) of multi-stranded acidic &alpha;-helices [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1141">1141</a><a name="r1141" id="r1141"></a>]. There are some families of associated proteins such as the nuclear lamins, sarcomere desmins,  neuron neurofilaments, and epithelial cytokeratins. In addition, the vimentins  (see right) generally support the organelles and maintain cellular integrity. All these  proteins possess &alpha;-helical central &lsquo;rod&rsquo; domains (&asymp; 48 nm long) that  contain about 310 amino acids plus more variable end domains,. At the same time, some  acidic groups form salt links with basic groups in other strands to build  up and lengthen the resulting &lsquo;elastic rope&rsquo; structure, there exists an excess  of acidic groups on the surface of the filaments. Within the &alpha;-helices are acidic bulges (formed from single &pi;-helical loops) containing clusters of three glutamic  acids within four residues and creating flexible &lsquo;linker&rsquo; regions. As different  strands come together to form the fibrous &lsquo;ropes&rsquo;, these acidic clusters are  grouped  with contributing acidic clusters from about 20 helices on the  surface of the filaments.
