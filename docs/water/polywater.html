    <p>One of the difficulties in putting forward novel ideas for the structure 
      of water is that the scientific press has been mistaken before and 
      now seemingly prefers to shuffle forward in the almost known and understood rather than take 
      long strides into the less well-known and less understood. This may be reinforced with publication referees manifestly preferring works that reinforce their own beliefs and publications but negatively reacting to opposing views. Of course, some revolutionary works and theories may simply be wrong, and some may be the result of  <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Eken/Langmuir/langmuir.htm" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin1" onclick="newWin('otherWin1')">pathological 
      science</a>. Other works, although correct, may falsely be regarded as <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Eken/Langmuir/langmuir.htm" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin1" onclick="newWin('otherWin1')">pathological 
      science</a> to 'support' the opposite views (confirmation bias).    </p>

    <p>The first water-related  mischance that the scientific literature fell into, 
    concerned polywater (see left small droplets made in a similar manner, &lt; 0.1 &micro;g, in 25 &micro;m diameter capillary tube, originally called anomalous water, modified water or super water) supported by a publication wave of over 500 'scientific' papers between 1962 and 1974. The polywater was reported to be a dense 
    (&gt; 1.3 g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>), high boiling &asymp; (200&nbsp;&deg;C), and viscous (20 &#739; increased)  form of 
    'polymeric' water. It was first quietly reported by the Russian Fedyakin in 1962 to spontaneously form by condensation in narrow 
    (&lt; 20 &mu;m) sealed capillaries even after great care had been made to keep the apparatus very clean and the  water very pure [<a  href="ref2.html#r122" name="r122" title="go to cited reference" id="r122">122</a>]. It was not formed by simply placing the water in the tubes, even if the temperature was raised. Particularly remarkable properties were that the material was more stable than 'normal' water and could be removed from the glass capillaries and the eccentric properties continued even after further boiling and condensation.
    There were many scientific meetings, wide media interest, and widely published supporting papers on the phenomenon, including publications in the most prestigious journals Nature and Science  in 1969-1970. Also, the ideas had been given momentum from the populist media and continuing support of the well-respected, honorable and careful, scientists, the American Ellis Lippincott, and the Russian Boris Deryagin.

    <p>As only micrograms of material were available, it was challenging to chemically analyze the 'polywater', but when analyses became available it was   shown to contain unforeseen impurities [<a  href="ref2.html#r123" name="r123" title="go to cited reference" id="r123">123</a>]. 
    The New York Times then made  unsubstantiated (and very unlikely concerning the original experiments but possible with later rushed preparations made solely for analysis) claims that  human sweat contamination caused the effects. However, some 
    samples contained just silica, dissolution of which was not anticipated 
    at that time as quartz vessels were known to hold water without noticeable dissolution.<sup><a href="#d" name="bd" id="bd"> a</a></sup> There were also delays in analyzing the polywater samples due to 
    the minuscule volumes available (&lt; &mu;g) 
    and consequentially low silica contents (&lt; 10<sup>&minus;4 </sup>&mu;g 
    as then determined). General recognition that the properties of anomalous 
    water were due to impurities (and not a new compound of H and O) was not before it had generated a considerable 
    theoretical literature, both for and, less embarrassingly particularly 
    early on, against. In hindsight, the impurities were probably exaggerated   in a rush to find blame. As computers and the theoretical base became more powerful, it has additionally become clear that there is no theoretical support for the hexagonal structuring proposed for 'polywater' (see top right). After it became clear that 'polywater' was not a polymer of water alone but also it was not a product of careless experimental work, many scientists, who should have known better, offered their derisive hindsight.

    <p>There was a positive outcome to this work in 
      that it did stimulate much work on water at that time and showed the importance of materials dissolved from water containers. However, the episode seems to be usually 
      remembered with discomfiture, and that has probably reduced the publications concerned, with water structure over the subsequent few years with many young scientists avoiding the area to steer clear of any similar pitfall or ridicule. Since then, high-density liquid water 
      has been verified to exist (<a href="water_phase_diagram.html" title="go to a description of water's phases">at low temperatures</a> [<a  href="ref.html#r16" name="r16" title="go to cited reference" id="r16">16</a>]), but this is unrelated 
      to any of the polywater samples. Polywater is still researched but 
       based on the properties of surfaces and concentrated electrolyte silica 
      condensates. </p>

    <p>Almost identical structures (see right) to 'polywater' (see top right of the figure) have  been re-introduced as support for Gerald Pollack's ideas in his self-published book 'The Fourth Phase of Water' (Ebner and Sons, Seattle, 2013), and variously related <a href="colligative_generation.html#EZ" title="go for more information">exclusion zone (EZ) water</a> papers (for example, [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2077">2077</a>a, c<a name="r2077" id="r2077"></a>]). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>However, Pollack's proposed structuring for the excluded zone water (<a href="colligative_generation.html#EZ"><abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>-water</a>, see right) appears even more unlikely than the original refuted structure for polywater [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3800">3800</a><a name="r3800" id="r3800"></a>]. Pollack  disregards many current basic and well-accepted scientific concepts to invent a structuring without any theoretical, thermodynamic, or experimental rationale for its formation, even well after this had been pointed out to him. <sup><a href="#e" name="be" id="be"> b </a></sup>Additionally, the proposed <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>-water structure supposedly forms multi-layers thousands of layers thick (see right showing just a few layers) proposed as linked by (fanciful) multiple triply-bonded hydrogen atoms between the layers (see below left). This proposed structure would result in an unrealistically  vast concentration of net negative charges to be present within its small space (&asymp; 43 M e<sup>&minus;</sup> net charge). In contrast, the measured pH changes are never significantly greater than 10<sup>&minus;3</sup> M with a voltage separation of 0.2 <a href="constants.html#V">V</a> (equivalent to the 10<sup>&minus;3</sup> M pH spread), an error factor of almost five ordered of magnitude. Further, the pH within the EZ-water is never independently established. Quantum-chemical computations show that Pollack's<abbrev> </abbrev>structure for <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> would be unstable and immediately dissipate [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref21.html#r2077">2077</a>b] with an enormous energy release that exceeds that of chemical explosives. For example, even the cyclic (H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup><strong>-</strong></sup>)<sub>3</sub> partial structure is grossly unstable and rapidly dissociates into three H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup><strong>-</strong></sup> entities that repel each other.</p>

    <p>When calculated, the energy required to assemble Pollack's structure for <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ-</abbr>water runs into millions of kilojoules per mole H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup>. No mechanism exists that can stabilize such a structure.   A further damning fact is that exclusion zones are found in other liquids such as dimethyl sulfoxide  (DMSO, see right) where there is no chance of Pollack's <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr> structure being present as there is no H<sub>2</sub>O [<a  title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1742">1742</a><a name="r1742" id="r1742"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>My conclusion is that  Pollack's suggested structure for <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ-</abbr>water is nonsense, but the existence of the <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ-</abbr>water is proven but must have a different structure to that proposed by Pollack. <abbr title="exclusion zone">EZ</abbr>-water forms a liquid 'phase'  that can be legitimately treated as different from 'bulk' liquid water. </p>
