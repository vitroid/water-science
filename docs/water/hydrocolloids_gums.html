Colloids are heterogeneous systems with at least two phases, one having dimension(s) between a few nanometers and a few micrometers. Colloids are distinguished by their inability to pass through 'dialysis' membranes. Most colloids get drawn into the gas-liquid interface [<a  href="ref27.html#r2679" name="r2679" title="go to cited reference" id="r2679">2679</a>] and are, therefore, somewhat surface active. Proteins, therefore, are liable to denaturation if shaken to a foam.</p>

    <p align="left"> Hydrocolloids [<a  href="ref3.html#r227" name="r227" title="go to cited reference" id="r227">227</a>], often called gums,<a href="hydrocolloids_gums.html#a" name="ba" id="ba2"><sup>a</sup></a> are hydrophilic<a href="hydrocolloids_gums.html#b" name="bb" id="bb"><sup>b</sup></a> polymers, of vegetable, animal, microbial or synthetic origin that 
      generally contain many hydroxyl groups and may be polyelectrolytes. 
      They are naturally present or added to control the functional properties 
      of aqueous foodstuffs. Most important amongst these properties are solubility [<a href="ref26.html#r2560">2560</a><a name="r2560" id="r2560"></a>], <a href="rheology.html">viscosity</a> (including thickening and gelling), 
      and water binding (see right [<a href="ref19.html#r1815">1815</a><a name="r1815" id="r1815"></a>]). Also significant are many other properties,  including 
      organoleptic, emulsion stabilization [<a href="ref36.html#r3565">3565</a><a name="r3565" id="r3565"></a>], and prevention of ice recrystallization. The degree with which the hydrocolloid solutions mix with saliva, determined by their degree of chain entanglement, determines flavor perception [<a href="ref11.html#r1050">1050</a><a name="r1050" id="r1050"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Other more specialist applications include 
      adhesion, suspension, flocculation, foam stabilization, and film 
      formation. Foodstuffs are very complex materials, and this, together 
      with the multifactorial functionality of the hydrocolloids, has resulted 
      in several different hydrocolloids being required. The most useful
      hydrocolloids are listed below.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Each of these hydrocolloids consists of mixtures of similar, but 
      not identical, molecules and different sources,  preparative methods, 
      thermal processing, and foodstuff environment (for example, salt 
      content, pH, and temperature) all affect the physical properties 
      they exhibit. Descriptions of hydrocolloids often present idealized 
      structures, but it should be remembered that they are natural products 
      (or derivatives) with structures determined by stochastic enzymic 
      action, not laid down precisely by the genetic code. They consist of mixtures of molecules with different relative molecular mass (molecular weight)s. No two molecules are likely to be conformationally identical or even 
      structurally identical (<a href="cellulose.html">cellulose</a> excepted) 
      to any other. [<a title="go to top of page" href="hydrocolloids_gums.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>

    <p>Many hydrocolloids are polyelectrolytes; for example <a title="go for more information" href="alginate.html">alginate</a>, <a title="go for more information" href="carrageenan.html">carrageenan</a>, <a title="go for more information" href="carboxymethylcellulose.html">carboxymethyl-cellulose</a>, <a title="go for more information" href="gum_arabic.html">gum arabic</a>, <a title="go for more information" href="pectin.html">pectin,</a> and <a title="go for more information" href="xanthan_gum.html">xanthan gum</a>. The charged groups ensure strong hydration, particularly on a per molecule basis. The presence of counterions and co-ions (ions with the same charge as the polyelectrolyte) introduce complex behavior that is ion-specific and depends on the concentrations of all ionic solutes [<a  href="ref15.html#r1473" name="r1473" title="go to cited reference" id="r1473">1473</a>]. A proportion of the counterions remain tightly associated with the polyelectrolyte, being trapped in its electrostatic field and  reducing their activity and mobility, with the non-ideality of the solutions increasing on dilution down to very low levels as the associated proportion of the counterions increases. Their behavior changes when the concentration of the polyelectrolyte necessitates the overlap of their structures [<a  href="ref15.html#r1493" title="go to cited reference">1493</a>].    The distinction between strong and weak polyelectrolytes  has been clarified based on single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4398">4398</a><a name="r4398" id="r4398"></a>]. Unsurprisingly, the strong polyelectrolyte with a more considerable ionization  degree has a more extended conformation and greater bound water content.    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The structures and properties (e.g.,  such as chain conformation, hydration, stiffness, surface wettability, lubricity, adhesion, and protein adsorption) of both strong and weak polyelectrolytes vary with pH. Weak polyelectrolytes containing weak acid or basic groups (such as carboxylates and primary amines) vary primarily due to the pH-controlled proton association/dissociation equilibria of their acidic or basic groups. These pH-controlled proton association/dissociation equilibria are not effective with strong polyelectrolytes containing strong acid or basic groups (such as, sulfonates and quaternary amines). However, there are still significant changes with pH due to the pH dependence of interchain hydrogen-bonding interactions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3183">3183</a><a name="r3183" id="r3183"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;  </p>
    <div style="float:none; clear:both;">
      <p>The<a title="go for more information" href="rheology.html#red"> reduced viscosity</a> of such solutions increases on dilution as the polyelectrolyte chains stiffen. These properties of polyelectrolytes are more noticeable as the linear charge density (number of charged groups per unit length) increases. Properties of these solutions (such as enthalpy of dilution  [<a  href="ref15.html#r1473">1473</a>]) are difficult to predict  [<a  href="ref26.html#r2562" name="r2562" title="go to cited reference" id="r2562">2562</a>] as small changes in the polyelectrolyte concentration, <a href="water_dissociation.html#o">ionic strength,</a> or specific ions may result in large changes in the three-dimensional structure of the polyelectrolyte, including the possibility of the formation of <a title="go for more information" href="aqueous_biphasic.html">aqueous biphasic systems</a>. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Polyelectrolytes induce water-water correlations over distances more extensive than that of the electrolyte, leading to substantially reduced viscosity. This has been explained by nuclear quantum effects between the water molecules causing H-bond breakage through rotations more  than  hydrogen-bond stretching [<a  href="ref40.html#r3973" name="3973" title="go to cited reference" id="r3973">3973</a>].</p>

    <h2><a name="mix" id="mix"></a>Mixtures of hydrocolloids</h2>
    <p>Mixtures of hydrocolloids (gums) show such a complexity of non-additive 
      properties that it is only recently that these can be interpreted 
      as a science rather than an art. There is enormous potential in 
      combining the structure-function knowledge of polysaccharides with 
      that of the structuring of water. The particular parameters of each 
      application must be scrutinized, noting the effects required 
      (for example, texture, flow, bite, water content, stability, stickiness, 
      cohesiveness, resilience, springiness, extensibility, processing 
      time, process tolerance), and taking due regard of the type, source, 
      grade and structural heterogeneity of the hydrocolloid(s).</p>

    <p>Mixed hydrocolloids, at low concentrations (<strong>a</strong>), 
      influence large volumes of water within their <a title="go for more information" href="rheology.html#rg">radius 
      of gyration</a>. As the concentrations increase, different 
      scenarios are possible. Individual molecules may fold up to 
      form globular structures (<strong>b</strong>). This entropy-driven 
      process allows the retention of rotational freedom. Further 
      concentration (<strong>c</strong>) may cause phase separation 
      (<strong>d</strong>) due to the different influences on the 
      water structuring.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>More commonly, hydrocolloids retain their extended structures. 
      This may lead to mixed entanglement (<strong>f</strong>; 
      rarer) or phase-separated entanglement (<strong>e</strong>, 
      commoner). Mixed entanglement may give rise to gels (<strong>g</strong>) 
      at higher concentrations. Phase separations may be entropy-driven 
      as they may allow greater freedom of movement due to the similarity 
      in the molecular shapes (<strong>h</strong>).</p>

    <p>All <a title="go for more information" href="polysaccharide_hydration.html">hydrocolloids interact with water</a>, 
      reducing its diffusion and stabilizing its presence. Generally, neutral 
      hydrocolloids are less soluble, whereas polyelectrolytes are more 
      soluble. However, hydration kinetics depend on many factors; xanthan, 
      guar, and carboxymethyl-cellulose are soluble in cold water, but carrageenan, 
      locust bean gum, and many alginates require hot water for complete 
      hydration. Such water may be held specifically through direct hydrogen 
      bonding, or water structuring, or within extensive but contained 
      inter- and intra-molecular voids. Interactions between hydrocolloids 
      and water depend on <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen bonding</a> and, 
      therefore, on temperature and pressure in the same way as <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html">water 
      cluster</a> formation. Sometimes junction-zones arise, forming gels. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Similarly, there is a reversible balance 
      between entropy loss and enthalpy gain, but the process may be kinetically 
      limited, and optimum networks may never be achieved. Hydrocolloids 
      may exhibit a wide range of conformations in solution as the links 
      along the polymeric chains can rotate relatively freely within valleys 
      in the <a title="go for more information" href="polysaccharides.html#land">potential energy landscapes</a>. 
      Large, conformationally stiff hydrocolloids present essentially 
      static surfaces encouraging extensive structuring in the surrounding 
      water. Water binding affects texture and processing characteristics, 
      prevents syneresis,<a href="hydrocolloids_gums.html#c" name="bc" id="bc"><sup>c</sup></a> and may have a substantial economic benefit. In particular, hydrocolloids can provide water for increasing 
      the flexibility (plasticizing, making more rubbery [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2245">2245</a><a name="r2245" id="r2245"></a>]) of other food components. They can 
      also affect ice crystal formation and growth so exerting a particular 
      influence on the texture of frozen foods. Some hydrocolloids, such 
      as <a href="locust_bean_gum.html">locust bean gum</a> and <a href="xanthan_gum.html">xanthan 
      gum</a>, may form stronger gels on freeze-thaw due to kinetically 
      irreversible changes consequent upon a forced association as water 
      is removed (as ice) on freezing [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r468">468</a><a name="r468" id="r468"></a>].

    <h2><a name="vis" id="vis"></a>Effect on viscosity</h2>
    <p>As hydrocolloids can dramatically affect the flow behavior of many 
      times their  weight of water, most hydrocolloids (gums) are used to 
      increase the viscosity (see <a href="rheology.html">rheology page</a>), 
      which is used to stabilize foodstuffs by preventing settling, phase 
      separation, foam collapse, and crystallization. Viscosity generally 
      changes with concentration, temperature [<a  href="ref3.html#r236" name="r236" title="go to cited reference" id="r236">236</a>], 
      and <a href="rheology.html">shear strain rate</a> in a complex manner 
      dependent on the hydrocolloid(s) and other materials present; mixtures 
      of hydrocolloids may act synergically to increase viscosity, or antagonistically 
      to reduce it. These changes may generally be fitted to equations 
      such as:</p>

      and hardness and brittleness dependent on the structure of the hydrocolloid(s)

      Hydrocolloids display both elastic and viscous behavior 
      where the elasticity occurs when the entangled polymers are unable

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Atomic force microscopy has been used to clarify the network structures on gelling. It gives useful results so long as care is taken that the structures do not change during preparation [<a  href="ref13.html#r1242" name="r1242" title="go to cited reference" id="r1242">1242</a>]. [<a title="go to top of page" href="hydrocolloids_gums.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>
    <h2><a name="act" id="act2"></a>Hydrocolloid action</h2>
    <p>These properties of hydrocolloids must be due, both singly and 
      in concert, to their structural characteristics and the way they 
      interact with water. For example:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hydrocolloids gel when intra-molecular or inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding 
        (and sometimes salt formation) is favored over hydrogen-bonding 
        (and sometimes ionic interactions) to water to a sufficient extent 
        to overcome the entropic cost. Often the hydrocolloids exhibit 
        a delicate balance between hydrophobicity <a href="hydrocolloids_gums.html#b" name="bb2" id="bb3"><sup>b</sup></a> and hydrophilicity. Extended hydrocolloids tend to tangle at higher 
        concentrations. Similar molecules may be able to wrap around 
        each other (forming helical junction zones) without loss of hydrogen 
        bonding but reducing conformational heterogeneity and minimizing 
        hydrophobic surface contact with water, releasing it for more 
        energetically favorable use elsewhere. Under such circumstances, 
        a minimum number of links may need to be formed (that is, a junction zone which, if helical, generally requires a complete 
        helix) to overcome the entropy effect and form a stable link. Where junction zones grow slowly with time, 
        the interactions eliminate water, and syneresis may occur (as in 
        some jam and jelly).</li>
      <li>Polysaccharide hydrocolloids stabilize emulsions (see  [<a  href="ref16.html#r1501" name="r1501" title="go to cited reference" id="r">1501</a>]) primarily by 
        increasing the viscosity, slowing the thermodynamically favored 
        breakdown of the emulsion. However, they may also act as emulsifiers, where 
        their emulsification ability is reported as mainly being due to 
        accompanying (contaminating or intrinsic) more hydrophobic protein moieties [<a  href="ref4.html#r309" name="r309" title="go to cited reference" id="r2">309</a>, <a href="ref36.html#r3565">3565</a>]. 
        In particular, electrostatic interaction between ionic hydrocolloids 
        and proteins may give rise to marked emulsification ability with 
        considerable stability so long as the appropriate pH and ionic 
        strength regime are continued. Denaturation of the protein is likely 
        to lead to improved emulsification ability and stability.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Mixtures of hydrocolloids may avoid self-aggregation at high 
        concentrations due to structural heterogeneity, which discourages 
        crystallization but encourages solubility. Hydrocolloids may interact 
        with other food components, such as aiding the emulsification of 
        fats, stabilizing milk protein micelles, or affecting the stickiness 
        of gluten.</li>
      <li>The particle size of hydrocolloids and their distribution are 
        important parameters concerning the rate of hydration and emulsification 
        ability.</li>
      <li>Negatively charged hydrocolloids change their structural characteristics 
        with counterion type and concentration (including pH and ionic 
        strength effects); for example, at high acidity, the charges disappear, 
        and the molecules become less extended.</li>
      <li>Physical characteristics may be controlled by thermodynamics 
        or kinetics (and hence processing history and environment) dependent 
        on concentration. In particular, these may change with time in 
        a monotonic or oscillatory manner.</li>
      <li>Different hydrocolloids prefer <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html">low-density 
        or higher density water</a> and other hydrocolloids show compatibility 
        with both. As more intra-molecular hydrogen bonds form, so the 
        hydrocolloids become more hydrophobic. This may change the 
        local structuring of the water. Mixed hydrocolloids preferring 
        different environments produce 'excluded volume' effects on each 
        other's effective concentration and hence <a href="rheology.html">rheology</a>.</li>
      <li>In the <a href="amorphous_ice.html#e" title="go for an explanation" >glassy</a> state, conformational changes are severely inhibited, 
        but the water held by hydrocolloids may act as a plasticizer (allowing 
        molecular motion), significantly reducing the glass transition temperature 
        by breaking inter-molecular hydrogen-bonding [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref23.html#r2245">2245</a>]).</li>
</ul>

    <p>Hydrocolloids and other dietary fiber are increasingly 
      being seen as contributing to a healthy diet, having some 
      positive <a href="dietary_fiber.html">health benefits</a>. Although this 
      site concentrates on food aspects, hydrocolloids also have many 
      other major economic uses, such as  chemicals, oil, and cosmetic

    <p>Hydrogels are water-based hydrophilic crosslinked polymers  [<a  href="ref29.html#r2893" name="r2893" title="go to cited reference" id="r2893">2893</a>,<a  href="ref41.html#r4031" name="r4031" title="go to cited reference" id="r4031">4031</a>], such as poly-N, N-dimethylacrylamide (PDMAA),  2-hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate (HEMA),   vinyl pyrrolidone (VP), and calcium alginate [<a  href="ref41.html#r4089" name="r4089" title="go to cited reference" id="r4089">4089</a>] that are capable of saturated swelling to a jelly-like consistency and absorb and hold vast amounts of water (10 - 1000 times its  weight) within their three-dimensional network [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref25.html#r2455">2455</a><a name="r2455" id="r2455"></a>]; thus containing pools of water averaging &asymp; 25 nm<sup>3</sup> - &asymp; 25,000 nm<sup>3</sup>. Hydrogels possess high biocompatibility and  high permeability. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The water within hydrogels is divided between (a) non-freezing and strongly bound, (b)  freezing and weakly bound, and (c) non-bound, free water, with further water species in the loosely bound and free water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3907">3907</a><a name="r3907" id="r3907"></a>]. It is at higher pressure inside than the bulk, which affects its latent heat, salt solubility, and the important water retention ability [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref44.html#r4390">4390</a><a name="r4390" id="r4390"></a>].. In the fully swollen state, much of the water is free water. On dehydration, this free water evaporates first, followed by the weakly-bound water. Further dehydration gives rise to gel and glassy states with some water remaining. The strength of the hydrogen bonds formed by water often decreases with decreasing water content due to the lower hydrogen-bond cooperativity. Raman spectroscopy has been used to investigate the mechanism of the structural changes of water that are induced by changes in the polymer structure of polyacrylamide (PAA) and poly-N,N,-dimethylacrylamide (PDMAA) hydrogels during dehydration [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3449">3449</a><a name="r3449" id="r3449"></a>]. This study found that the bound water in the PAA hydrogel  primarily forms four strong hydrogen bonds  between the side chains of PAA. In contrast, the PDMAA hydrogel water  only weakly binds to form a network of hydrogen bonds with other water molecules.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The properties of hydrogel's water also depend on any  solutes present, the pH, salinity, and the structural features of the hydrogel  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3360">3360</a><a name="r3360" id="r3360"></a>]. However, ultra-fast infrared two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) vibrational echo and polarization-selective pump-probe (PSPP) spectroscopies have shown that the hydrogen-bonding network reorganization (spectral diffusion) dynamics  are significantly slower than in bulk water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3383">3383</a><a name="r3383" id="r3383"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Hydrogels are primarily known for their use in sanitary products and nappies but also have usages over a broad spectrum, including food additives, tissue engineering, soft contact lenses, pharmaceuticals, and therapeutic delivery  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3191">3191</a><a name="r3191" id="r3191"></a>]. Commonly used materials make use of polyacrylates, but hydrogels may be made by crosslinking soluble hydrocolloids to make an insoluble but elastic and hydrophilic polymer. The elastic crosslinking limits  the network and prevents the complete dissolution of hydrogels. The water is necessarily held  in pools of bound water that have little tendency to drain out. As the hydrogel hydrates, the long-range network of hydrophilic groups expands to hold more water. At the same time,  the hydrophobic short-range structures are shortened due to repulsive interactions with the surrounding water molecules [<a  href="ref29.html#r2852" name="r2852" title="go to cited reference" id="r2852">2852</a>]. </p>

    <p>The three main types of 3-D hydrogels are shown simplified on the right. Homopolymers  are composed of a single polymer type (e.g., poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate); heteropolymers are composed of two or more polymers crosslinked together, and interpenetrating polymer networks comprise two different polymers that are physically entangled but not covalently linked [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3045">3045</a><a name="r3045" id="r3045"></a>]. In 2021, gelatin was developed into non-melting ice cubes to cool foodstuffs [<a href="ref44.html#r4396">4396</a><a name="r4396" id="r4"></a>]. These  are made of about 90% water and may be shaped, but are recyclable, biodegradable, and importantly may be used in repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The uniform gelatin framework was optimized by repetative rapid freezing and  slow thawing.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are problems associated with determining the hydration structure of hydrogels as the structuring encompasses nano-, micro-, and macro-scales with the hydrogel function dependent on the various aqueous pools sizes and their distribution. The high osmotic pressure generated by these materials can explain their high affinity for water. The diffusion behavior of small particles (including water) in hydrogels is determined by the characteristic sizes of the hydrogel particle  and the polymer network [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref36.html#r3522">3522</a><a name="r3522" id="r3522"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) is a popular method for structural elucidation. However, the hydrated hydrogel must be 'fixed' to withstand the required high vacuum, and the results depend on these 'fixed' structures being representative of the native structures. Many methods appear to give artifactual structures damaged by ice crystal formation. Also, the addition of cryoprotectants can disturb the native structuring. It has been proposed that the native state is retained by the freezing of thin (&asymp;  15 &micro;m) samples using a - 186&nbsp;&deg;C propane jet  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2946">2946</a><a name="r2946" id="r2946"></a>]. </p>

    <p>Tough adhesives that bond to wet surfaces may be formed using hydrogels in an integrated backing for adhesive surfaces [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2980">2980</a><a name="r2980" id="r2980"></a>]. Their manufacture was inspired by a slug's defensive mucus that firmly sticks to wet surfaces and prevents the slug's detachment from that surface by predators. The hydrogel backing dissipates any deforming forces. Self-healing hydrogels that can spontaneously repair themselves to reinstate their original 3D network and performance have been developed [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref41.html#r4032">4032</a><a name="r4032" id="r4032"></a>].

    <p>Some hydrogels can be used at ultralow temperature (&minus; 80 &#8451;) for long periods (about a month) without freezing, by the addition of LiC [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref45.html#r4434">4434</a><a name="r4434" id="r4434"></a>].

It assumes the particle stability depends on long-range interactions and describes the balance between two forces, electrostatic double-layer repulsion   and long-range <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> attraction (involving atom-based electron fluctuations),  giving an energetically favored separation distance (see 'minimum' energy position below). The interaction between charged colloidal particles in a concentrated suspension has been described [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3021">3021</a><a name="r3021" id="r3021"></a>].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the  liquid between interacting bodies is assumed to have bulk properties up to molecular distances, the DLVO theory fails at short distances from hydrophilic surfaces and ions where short-range interactions dominate  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3012">3012</a><a name="r3012" id="r3012"></a>].</p>

    <p>The van der Waals attraction is  relatively insensitive to the concentration of the electrolytes. It dominates when the separation between the surfaces is slight, whereas the electrostatic double-layer repulsion is quite sensitive to the concentration of electrolytes and is strong at larger separations. The <abbr title="Derjaguin &amp; Landau and Vervey &amp; Overbeek">DLVO</abbr> theory is generally used to  explain colloid behavior qualitatively. However, it does not hold at short distances (less than about 5 nm) in liquid water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3030">3030</a><a name="r3030" id="r3030"></a>], and it has been shown that its foundations are deeply flawed [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref38.html#r3760">3760</a><a name="r3760" id="r3760"></a>]. This error is due to the hydrated surfaces having long-range secondary hydration forces [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1726">1726</a><a name="r1726" id="r1726"></a>] and that kosmotropic and chaotropic ions behave differently within the hydrated surface layer.</p>

    <p>The <abbr title="Derjaguin &amp; Landau and Vervey &amp; Overbeek">DLVO </abbr>theory  does not hold for <a href="nanobubble.html">nanobubbles</a> where the van der Waals effect is negligible.
