    <p><strong><a name="rtx2" id="rtx2"></a>M. F. Chaplin, (2019) Structure and properties of water in its various  states, <em>Encyclopedia of Water: Science, Technology, and  Society</em>, Ed. P. A. Maurice, Wiley, DOI: <a aria-label="Digital Object Identifier" href="https://doi.org/10.1002/9781119300762.wsts0002">10.1002/9781119300762.wsts0002</a></strong>. Water is a unique substance with properties that are not predictable from those of other materials. It has a complex phase space where all of its physical and structural forms possess unexpected properties. Mostly, these are consequences of the ability of the water molecule to form strongly hydrogen-bonded intricate structures. The extensive hydrogen bonding provides water with the ability to transfer protons and electrons rapidly between the water molecules and to produce positively charged hydrogen ions and negatively charged hydroxide ions. Each water molecule forms exactly four hydrogen bonds in a tetrahedral arrangement with two hydrogen atoms near each oxygen atom. This arrangement is also present, if much more loosely, in liquid water, where the overall structuring is far more complex. Such liquid water behaves as though it is a mixture of two liquids that change relative composition with variations in temperature and pressure. The properties of liquid water are particularly affected at low temperatures when supercooled and at very low temperatures when water forms glasses. Even gaseous water is affected by this hydrogen bonding.    [<a href="martin_chaplin.html#rtx2"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

This pressure may oppose gas exit from nanobubbles and so stabilze them.

    <p><strong><a name="rt1" id="rt1"></a>M. F. Chaplin,  What is liquid water, <em>Science in Society</em>, 58 (2013) 41-45</strong>, Everyone knows some of the properties of liquid  water. Often they think of these properties as typical of liquids in general;  for example, most people believe all liquids dissolve gases less well at  higher temperatures. This is a mistake as the opposite is true. Liquid water  only behaves like most other liquids at very high temperatures (i.e., when  superheated) but is strange and atypical at low temperatures. Overall, liquid  water can be considered an intimate mixture of two miscible phases, one  predominant at lower temperatures and the other predominant at higher  temperatures. hydrogen-bonding is generally said to be the cause of these phenomena  but confusion still exists over what &lsquo;hydrogen-bonding&rsquo; in water entails. No  longer should we describe (or model) liquid water in terms of individual  water (H<sub>2</sub>O) molecules or describe water&rsquo;s hydrogen bond as simple  electrostatic interactions between discrete molecules. We must consider both  proton quantum effects and extensive electron delocalization within the network(s)  of water molecules (i.e., neither the protons nor electrons are pinned to individual  molecules).  &nbsp;[<a href="martin_chaplin.html#rt1"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

    <p><a name="r101" id="r23"></a><strong>Martin Chaplin, Theory vs experiment: What is the surface charge of water? <em>Water</em>, 1 (2009) 1-28</strong>, There is considerable disagreement over whether the gas/liquid surface of the water is positive due to the presence of surface-active hydrogen ions or negative due to the presence of surface-active hydroxyl ions. Much has been written and many experimental and simulation studies have been undertaken. We critically analyze these studies to establish what is known unambiguously and what assumptions underlie these opposite views. The conclusion reached after this examination is that there is much misunderstanding over the strength of the evidence for hydrogen ions being surface active and less support for the positive surface than generally regarded. The surface of neutral water has a negative charge.&nbsp;[<a href="martin_chaplin.html#r101"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>] </p>

Although  associated with the mechanism of homeopathy, this association may mislead.  There is strong evidence concerning many ways in which the mechanism of this  &lsquo;memory&rsquo; may be apparent.

      Liquid water is a highly versatile material.   Although it forms from the tiniest of molecules, it can shape and control   biomolecules. The hydrogen-bonding properties of water are crucial to this   versatility, as they allow water to execute an intricate three-dimensional   'ballet', exchanging partners while retaining complex order and enduring   effects. Water can generate small active clusters and macroscopic assemblies,   which can both transmit information on different scales.&nbsp;[<a href="martin_chaplin.html#r21"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

Intracellular K<sup>+</sup> ions are revealed to form ion pairs with acid-rich  domains on static proteins, particularly F-actin. Such structures then create  low-density water clustering by a cooperative process that  influences  other sites and so transfer information within the cell.&nbsp;[<a href="martin_chaplin.html#r20"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

The preferred orientations of this first shell water are affected by  the favored orientations of the second and more distant aqueous shells. If the  colloid surface is flexible, it enables greater freedom of movement within the  surface water molecules whereas if the surface is fixed, the adjacent water is  more static and more extensively structured. The surface structuring of water  is affected by, and will affect, the thermodynamics and kinetics for the  binding of other molecules to the surface. In this paper, examples of the  organization of water at colloidal surfaces are described and general  conclusions are drawn. These examples include (C<sub>60</sub>-<em>I</em>h)[5,6] fullerene, &beta;-helix  antifreeze proteins, and oxomolybdate clusters.

    <p><strong><a name="r18" id="r18"></a>M.  F. Chaplin. Water's hydrogen bond strength, <em> In</em>: <em>Water and Life</em>, ed. R. M. Lynden-Bell, S. Conway Morris, J. D. Barrow, J. L. Finney and C. L. Harper, Jr. (CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2010) pp. 69-86.</strong> Water is necessary both for the  evolution of life and its continuance. It possesses particular properties that  cannot be found in other materials and that are required for life-giving  processes. These properties are brought about by the hydrogen-bonded  environment particularly evident in liquid water. Each liquid water molecule is  involved in about four hydrogen bonds with strengths considerably less than  covalent bonds but considerably greater than the natural thermal energy. These  hydrogen bonds are roughly tetrahedrally arranged such that when strongly  formed the local clustering expands, decreasing the density. Such low-density  structuring naturally occurs at low and supercooled temperatures and gives rise  to many physical and chemical properties that evidence the particular  uniqueness of liquid water. If aqueous hydrogen bonds were actually somewhat  stronger then water would behave similar to a <a href="amorphous_ice.html#e" title="go for an explanation" >glass</a>, whereas if they were  weaker then water would be a gas and only exist as a liquid  at sub-zero temperatures.
      The quantitative and  qualitative consequences of strengthening or weakening of the hydrogen bond in  water are considered in this paper. It is found that if the hydrogen bond  strength was slightly different from its natural value then there may be  considerable consequences for life. At the extremes water would not be liquid  on the surface of Earth at its average temperature if the hydrogen bonds were 7%  stronger or 29% weaker. The temperature of maximum density naturally occurring  at about 4&nbsp;&deg;C would disappear if the hydrogen bonds were just 2% weaker. Major  consequences for life are found if the hydrogen bonds did not have their  natural strength. Even very slight strengthening of the hydrogen bonds may have  substantial effects on normal metabolism. Water ionization becomes much less  evident if the hydrogen bonds are just a few percent stronger but pure water contains  considerably more H+ ions if they are few percent weaker. The  important alkali metal ions Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> lose their  distinctive properties if the hydrogen bonds are 11% stronger or 11% weaker  respectively. Hydration of proteins and nucleic acids depends importantly on  the relative strength of the biomolecule-water interactions as compared with  the water-water hydrogen bond interactions. Stronger water hydrogen-bonding  leads to water molecules clustering together and so not being available for  biomolecular hydration. Generally, the extended denatured forms of proteins become  more soluble in water if the hydrogen bonds become substantially stronger or  weaker. If the changes in this bonding are sufficient, present natural globular  proteins cannot exist in liquid water.
      The  overall conclusion of this investigation is that water's hydrogen bond strength  is poised centrally within a narrow window of its suitability for life. &nbsp;[<a href="martin_chaplin.html#r18"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

      binding. <em>Proceedings of the Nutrition Society</em>, 62, 223-227. </strong>The range of interactions between fibre and water and the 
      consequential properties of the bound
      water are modeled and examined. Dietary fibre may interact with 
      water by means of polar and
      hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen-bonding and enclosure. The results 
      of these interactions vary
      with the flexibility of the fibre surface. When the fibre is insoluble 
      or junction zones are formed,
      this may result in profound changes in the surrounding water. Such 
      interactions are capable of
      affecting the structuring and solvation properties of water well 
      away from the immediate surfaces
      involved. In particular, the specific properties of water enclosed 
      by dietary fibre are examined, an
      area of investigation previously receiving scant attention. The 
      way this enclosure may affect the
      properties of water is exemplified by modeling the colon to show 
      how fibre may exert a beneficial
      action by the preferential partitioning of hydrophobic carcinogens. 
      Unfermented dietary fibre has
      a tendency to form low-density expanded water that acts as a preferential 
      solvent for hydrophobic
      molecules when compared with the less-structured denser water within 
      the much more hydrophilic
      mucus layer.&nbsp;[<a href="martin_chaplin.html#r16"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>] </p>

      62, 217-222.</strong> The primary structures of ispaghula husk and wheat bran were investigated 
      in order to determine
      how and why these fibres are among the most beneficial dietary fibres. 
      To this end, the
      polysaccharide preparations have been subjected to enzymic hydrolysis 
      and methylation analysis.
      The results have shown ispaghula husk and wheat bran to be very-highly-branched 
      arabinoxylans
      consisting of linear &beta;-D-(1<img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" />4)-linked

      linkages.
      Other substituents identified as present in wheat bran include &beta;-D-glucuronic acid attached via the

      arabinofuranosyl residues
      linked via 1-2, 1-3, and 1-4 linkages. Ispaghula-husk arabinoxylan 
      is more complex having
      additional side residues which include &alpha;-D-glucuronopyranose (GalA<em>p</em>)-(1<img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" />2)-linked- -L-rhamnopyranose-(1<img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" />4)-&beta;-D-Xyl<em>p</em>, &alpha;-D-GalA<em>p</em>-(1<img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" />3)-linked-&alpha;-L-Araf-(1<img src="images/reg.gif" alt="-&gt;" width="22" height="10" />4)-&beta;-D-Xyl<em>p</em>,

      The beneficial effects of increased fecal bulk

      of water remain puzzling. A fluctuating network of water molecules, 
      with localized icosahedral symmetry, is proposed to exist derived 
      from clusters containing, if complete, 280 fully hydrogen-bonded

      units of 14 water molecules that can tessellate locally, by changing 
      centers, in three-dimensions and interconvert between lower and 
      higher density forms. The structure allows explanation of many of 
      the anomalous properties of water including its temperature-density 
      and pressure-viscosity behavior, the radial distribution pattern, 
      the presence of both pentamers and hexamers, the change in properties

      in the reduced rate of nutrient absorption. Polysaccharides with 
      large hydrophobic surface areas have potentially important roles 
      in the binding of bile acids, carcinogens and mutagens. Ispaghula 
      is capable of binding bile acids through a large number of weak 
      binding sites on the polysaccharide structure, and having greatest 
      effect on the potentially more harmful secondary bile acids deoxycholic 
      acid and lithocholic acid.&nbsp;[<a href="martin_chaplin.html#r12"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

      with ispaghula husk affects the fecal bile acid weights and concentrations 
      in healthy adults. Sixteen healthy volunteers consumed 7.0 g/day 
      ispaghula husk, containing 5.88 g/day Englyst-determinable dietary 
      fibre, for the middle 8 weeks of a 12-week period. Stool samples 
      were collected, analyzed for fecal bile acids and their form and 
      dry weight determined. Correlations between the fecal bile acids, 
      the stool parameters and the dietary intake were tested. Ispaghula 
      husk treatment significantly lowers fecal lithocholic and isolithocholic 
      acids and the weighted ratio of lithocholic acids to deoxycholic 
      acid. These effects revert towards their initial states at the end 
      of the treatment period. These changes in the fecal bile acid profiles

      form a very diverse and complex family of biologically important

      to determine not only monosaccharides present and their linkage

      the ring size (furanose or pyranose), the absolute configuration 
      (D or L) and identify any other substituents present. There is no 
      one method that can be used to determine their fine structure; instead 
      we must use a combination of analytical methods to gain as much 
      information as we can. For analysis of disaccharide and oligosaccharide 
      mixtures, separation and quantification techniques such as colorimetric 
      and enzymatic assays, thin-layer chromatography or high performance 
      anion exchange chromatography may be applied. For polysaccharide 
      analysis separation and extraction techniques, component analysis, 
      methylation analysis, glycosidic hydrolysis, mass spectrometry methods, 
      and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy are required to determine 
      the fine structure and size exclusion chromatography coupled with 
      light scattering detectors to determine the molecular size distribution.&nbsp;[<a href="martin_chaplin.html#r8"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

      a family of dimeric metalloenzymes with a complex inactivation mechanism 
      that still remains to be elucidated. We have put forward a novel 
      mechanism of <em>Escherichia coli</em> alkaline phosphatase inactivation, 
      based on experimental as well as structural data for this isoenzyme. 
      It suggests several stages of disruption of the intersubunit contact 
      before the loss of enzyme activity. Here we present initial evidence 
      that the mechanism could also be valid for mammalian isoenzymes. 
      The evidence includes thermal inactivation kinetics and the structural 
      similarity of different alkaline phosphatases inferred from the 
      alignment of their amino acid sequences. The suggested inactivation 
      mechanism of alkaline phosphatases is supported by recent experimental 
      data showing an important role of three intersubunit contact areas 
      in determining the stability of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes.&nbsp;[<a href="martin_chaplin.html#r7"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

      Molecular Catalysis B-Enzmatic</em>, 7 (1-4), 165-172.</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The activity of oligomeric enzymes is sensitive 
      to the formation and dissociation of the interprotein contacts that 
      make up the conformational lock. The mechanism for this is discussed 
      in this article concerning the alkaline phosphatase (AP) from <em>Escherichia 
      coli.</em> Study of the AP from various source shows that the thermoinactivation 
      curves, obtained under various conditions, have induction periods 
      that may be ascribed to latent structural changes in the conformational 
      lock. The analysis of kinetic curves has allowed us to calculate 
      the minimum number of denaturation stages in the conformational 
      lock (n=3), that is, the stable dimer becomes labile and capable 
      of dissociation by the sequential dissociation of two of the three 
      contacts which take part in the conformational lock. Three-dimensional 
      structural analysis of AP from <em>E. coli</em> established that 
      the structure of intersubunit contact is formed by three sites: 
      two identical peripheral sites, formed by loop 1-29 and helix 29-34 
      (H 29-34) of each subunit and one, located near to the active centers 
      of two subunits. Destruction of two contacts does not effect the 
      catalytic activity but opening the third results in the dissociation 
      of dimers into monomers and loss of catalytic activity. Thus, kinetic 
      calculation is correlated with the results of structural analysis. 
      Oligomers with decreased activity and increased stability were found 
      in solutions of <em>E. coli</em> AP. The structural possibilities 
      for tetramer formation, based on packing of molecules in protein 
      crystals, are discussed.&nbsp;[<a href="martin_chaplin.html#r6"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>]</p>

      for the extraction of bile acids from feces is described. HPLC 
      with pulsed amperometric detection was used to examine and confirm 
      the recovery of bile acids. The analytes were extracted within a 
      period of 75 min using supercritical carbon dioxide at a pressure 
      of 34.5 MPa and a temperature of 90&nbsp;&deg;C. In developing this method 
      the following parameters were investigated: temperature, pressure, 
      and extraction time. Two alternative methods of sample preparation 
      were also investigated with a view to reducing the overall analysis 
      time. The method was validated for the major primary and secondary 
      bile acids found in feces. It was found that the overall mean&plusmn;SD
