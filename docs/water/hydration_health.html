      Liquid water is an essential nutrient throughout the living world  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1628">1628</a><a name="r1628" id="r1628"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2011">2011</a><a name="r2011" id="r2011"></a>]. 
      Although commonly  treated rather trivially, 
      no other nutrient is as essential or needed in as great 
      amounts. In particular, we cannot live without it for more than about 
      100 hours, whereas other nutrients may be neglected for weeks 
      or months. Our requirements are individual and depend on our physical activity,  dietary pattern, alcohol intake, health problems, environment, and age.</p>
    <h2><a name="con" id="con"></a>Water content </h2>
    <p>The water content of our bodies (methodology reviewed [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r961">961</a><a name="r961" id="r961"></a>]) 
      varies and is variable between individuals, generally dropping, 
      throughout our lives from above about 90% of total weight 
      as a fetus to 74% as an infant, 60% as a child, 59% as a 
      teenager (male; female 56%) 59% as an adult (male; female 
      50%) to 56% (male; female 47%) in the over-50&rsquo;s. <sup><a href="hydration_health.html#b2">b</a><a name="bb2" id="bb2"></a></sup> The gender 
      differences, from the teenage years onwards, are due to their 
      differing fat levels, as is the drop in the elderly who replace 
      muscle mass with fat.  If an allowance is made for this 
      fat content, there is little difference with gender 
      or age from childhood onwards. Body water is distributed between the cell interiors (intracellular 
      fluid, ICF, &asymp; 59%; &asymp; 26 L in a 75 kg man,  ICF, &asymp; 61%; &asymp; 19 L in a 60 kg woman [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1499">1499</a><a name="r1499" id="r1499"></a>]) 
      and the extracellular fluid (ECF, &asymp; 41%; &asymp; 18 L in a 75 kg man 
      including the &asymp; 3 L of plasma, &asymp; 12 L in a 60 kg woman  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1499">1499</a>]) (for reference values for extracellular water see [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1204">1204</a><a name="r1204" id="r1204"></a>]). Water 
      is free to move between the ICF and the ECF with any net movement 
      controlled by the effective osmotic and hydrostatic pressures. 
      The  water molecules have a biological half-life in our bodies of about 9-10 days with an average residence time of about two weeks. These estimates depend on  age, gender, build, and water consumption, with higher intakes giving shorter half-lives. The majority of the ions in the ICF are K<sup>+</sup> and 
      protein anions, whereas in the ECF, they are Na<sup>+</sup>, 
      Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> and bicarbonate. </p>

    <p>All values will vary with diet, activity, and climate. The 
      water ingested is determined by social, practical, and psychological 
      factors with need indicated by thirst when the body becomes 
      dehydrated. Water output is regulated by hormonal action and 
      the production of urine by the kidneys, which usually can 
      adapt to the body&lsquo;s hydration status.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Water balance during sporting and similar activity can be derived from the weight loss less liquid intake, so long as metabolic activity (metabolic water gain and substrate oxidation mass loss) is also accounted for  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1523">1523</a><a name="r1523" id="r1523"></a>]. As glycogen use, during high activity, is associated with the loss of the water stored alongside it (about 2.5-gram water per gram glycogen), not all the weight loss on exercise needs to be replaced by water immediately. Moving from a high carbohydrate diet to a high-fat diet can see a three-kilogram weight loss from glycogen depletion (see <a href="https://fellrnr.com/wiki/Practical_Hydration">practical hydration</a>).</p>

    <p align="right">[<a title="go to top of page" href="hydration_health.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>
    <h2><a name="req" id="req"></a>Water requirements </h2>
    <p>The actual amount of liquid water (from drinks) that an individual 
      requires depends on their age, gender, physical activity, physiological 
      condition or illness, and the temperature and <a href="water_vibrational_spectrum.html#l">humidity</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref25.html#r2464">2464</a><a name="r2464" id="r2464"></a>] of their 
      physical environment. A healthy individual may have slightly 
      lower or somewhat higher water intake without harm by varying 
      their urine output. The recommended amounts are somewhat higher 
      (1.0-1.5 mL  &#739; kcal  <sup>&minus;1</sup> ) than the average daily intake, being about 2.9 
      L for men and 2.2 L for women (rising to 4.8 L if pregnant 
      or 3.3 L if lactating) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r962">962</a><a name="r962" id="r962"></a>]l. 
      These higher levels of water intake seem to reduce the occurrences 
      of kidney stones, gallstones, and some cancers and may be 
      otherwise beneficial [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r963">963</a><a name="r963" id="r963"></a>]. 
      However, there appears to be no scientific source for the argument 
      in favor of an important nutrient. There is insufficient evidence for either the benefit or the lack of any benefit, from drinking increased amounts of water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref15.html#r1446">1446</a><a name="r1446" id="r1446"></a>]. However, 
      low water intake  levels do not seem to show any health 
      benefits and may be harmful.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Men require more water than women due to their higher (on 
      average) fat-free mass and energy expenditure. Infants<sup><a href="hydration_health.html#a2"> a</a><a name="ba2" id="ba2"></a></sup> and 
      young children need  more water in proportion to their 
      body weight as they cannot concentrate their urine as efficiently 
      as adults. Their surface area relative to their weight 
      is more extensive, giving rise to greater water loss from 
      the skin. Often children are under-hydrated  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref20.html#r1907">1907</a><a name="r1907" id="r1907"></a>]. The elderly should  ensure adequate 
      hydration, as aging diminishes the sensation of thirst and the ability to concentrate the urine  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref24.html#r2393">2393</a><a name="r2393" id="r2393"></a>].  However, it is difficult to accurately screen older people for dehydration by non-invasive tests [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref26.html#r2600">2600</a><a name="r2600" id="r2600"></a>].</p>

    <p>The water requirements, regulation, and balance (hydroregulation) of cold-blooded organisms (ectotherms) are closely connected to their thermoregulation [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref37.html#r3664">3664</a><a name="r3664" id="r3664"></a>].</p>

    <p>Water in the atmosphere (relative humidity) controls how hot we feel. In hot weather. The heat is more unbearable when combined with  higher  relative humidity. Thus, where the air temperature is 32&nbsp;&deg;C, this feels like 32&nbsp;&deg;C, 38&nbsp;&deg;C, 45&nbsp;&deg;C, and 56&nbsp;&deg;C, at 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% relative humidity respectively. This is due to the increased difficulty that sweating has in cooling us down at high humidities due to the slower rate of cooling evaporation at high relative humidities.</p>

    <h2><a name="hyd" id="hyd"></a>Hydration</h2>
    <p>Hydration status is difficult to define or determine precisely 
      or accurately. An indicator of hydration status is the <a href="moles_molarity_molality.html#osm">osmolality</a> of the blood. However, it is usually closely controlled around 
      about 284 mOsmol/kg (increasing slightly (1-2 %) in the elderly 
      and decreasing &asymp; 3% during pregnancy) and is, therefore, a 
      relatively poor indicator of hydration status. Short-term 
      hydration status may be determined easiy and accurately by 
      weight. Only water content affects weight over short periods 
      when food intake, fecal output, and other possibly confounding 
      factors (such as sweaty or changed clothing) are controlled.</p>

    <p>Although the problem of dehydration in elite athletes  appears to be  exaggerated [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref20.html#r1910">1910</a><a name="r1910" id="r"></a>], dehydration (starting at about 2-3% loss of body weight) 
      otherwise causes a range of symptoms from tiredness, headaches, and decreased 
      alertness to collapse and death (at more than 10% loss of 
      body weight). Mild symptoms may be seen in the lack of concentration 
      of schoolchildren towards the end of their school day, with an improved concentration in those less thirsty [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1558">1558</a><a name="r1558" id="r1558"></a>]. Severe 
      symptoms of dehydration are sometimes evident in the elderly 
      due to restricted water intake for medical, psychological, 
      or social reasons [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3767">3767</a><a name="r3767" id="r3767"></a>]. Hypohydration may give rise to impaired vascular function and greater cardiovascular disease risk. Increased water intake is usually easily 
      controlled due to the effective functioning of the kidneys 
      to produce more urine. Suppose this does not occur due to greatly 
      excessive water intake (for example, &gt; 1.0 L/hr) or kidney 
      disorder, then the extra water (hyperhydration) may produce 
      low blood sodium levels and cause the brain to swell, resulting 
      in death.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Water should be drunk little but often throughout the day 
      such that we are never thirsty [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r474">474</a><a name="r474" id="r474"></a>], but with care certainly that we are not over-hydrated as a 2% over-hydration producing generalized edema that can impair athletic and mental performance [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref20.html#r1910">1910</a>]. It is particularly important 
      to hydrate as the last activity at night to prepare for the significant 
      loss of water during sleeping and rehydrate first thing in 
      the morning. This is a time when the blood is most viscous 
      and strokes particularly prevalent. We should also drink before, 
      during, and after exercise to maintain our level of hydration. 
      The thirst-quenching ability of soft drinks has been assessed 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r964">964</a><a name="r964" id="r964"></a>]. Acidity 
      was  the most closely related taste attribute,  with 
      thirst-quenching, with sweetness and &lsquo;thickness&rsquo; (viscosity) 
      being the most contra-indicated.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The   hydration rate is best measured by the use of D<sub>2</sub>O uptake into saliva  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1231">1231</a><a name="r1231" id="r1231"></a>].  Water has to be rapidly emptied from the stomach and absorbed by the small intestine for rapid absorption, Typically this takes as little as 20-30 minutes, with half of a 300 mL drink being absorbed within about 15  (at rest) to 20 (after exercise) minutes. The   uptake rate is faster when at rest than when exercising with '<a href="hydration_health.html#sport" title="go below for explanation">sports drinks</a>', containing sugar and salt, showing a marginally faster rate at rest, but a similar time for complete absorption. In this study  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1231">1231</a>], there was no difference in the absorption rate, or time for complete absorption, between 'sports drinks' and water when taken after exercise. </p>

    <p>In the light of the increased promotion of <a href="polywater.html" title="go to new page for explanation">'special'

      there are definite and <a href="https://water.lsbu.ac.uk/water/www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/08/210824104113.htm">proven health benefits</a> from simply

    <h2><a name="dri" id="dri"></a>Drinking water </h2>
    <p>There is no such thing as naturally pure water; all waters 
      we drink contain dissolved solutes, and many contain some microorganisms 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r965">965</a><a name="r965" id="r965"></a>]. Indeed, drinking 'pure' water, even if obtainable, when it would be costly and prone to unwanted materials being introduced during its production and storage, is not a healthy option as essential minerals are absent 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1145">1145</a><a name="r1145" id="r1145"></a>]. There 
      are several forms that the water we drink may take [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref27.html#r2652">2652</a><a name="r2652" id="r2652"></a>], which 
      vary subtly from each other; drinking water, spring water, 
      tap water, natural mineral water, and water preparations are promoted 
      with various health claims. Our perception of the water's drinkability is governed by its 'descriptors' rather than its contents [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2092">2092</a><a name="r2092" id="r2092"></a>]. Bottled waters are subject to 
      international regulations but are not necessarily safer than 
      tap water. All such water must be drinkable, contain 
      solutes (including those classed as contaminants) below the 
      legally allowed limits,  be bacteriologically safe, and be 
      subject to continued monitoring.&nbsp;The presence of minerals (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is noteworthy. Hard drinking water (&gt;&asymp; 1.2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) seems protective against cardiovascular disease compared to soft water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3246">3246</a><a name="r3246" id="r3246"></a>]. The absence of such minerals may be harmful if the water is habitually drunk or drunk in large amounts.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Natural and recycled water usually undergoes several processes before it is considered drinkable tap water. These include, in order, </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Filtered to  remove debris</li>
    <li><span data-mce-mark="1">Coagulation and Flocculation</span><span data-mce-mark="1"> - Charged molecules are added to the water to coagulate impurities</span></li>
      <li>Clarified to remove suspended solids</li>
      <li>Treated with ozone to oxidize pesticides and herbicides and kill bacteria and algae, Then the ozone is destroyed</li>
      <li>Filtered further with granular activated carbon  to remove organic matter</li>
<li>Treated with chlorine to kill remaining bacteria. </li>
</ul>
    <ul>
    <li>Sometimes fluoridation - Fluoride may be added (0.7 &ndash; 1 mg F<sup>&minus;</sup>  &#739; L<sup>&minus;1</sup>) to increase resistance to dental caries in an attempt to prevent the   tooth decay </li>
</ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Despite the high quality and rigorous control of  tap water in developed countries, bottled water consumption is highly significant and has substantially increased over recent years. This is despite its high cost and environmental concerns over plastic bottles. The main reason given for this is taste, but blind taste tests have not supported this, with taste differences being illusionary rather than actual [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3338">3338</a><a name="r3338" id="r3338"></a>].</p>

        <td width="85%"><p>Water, from any source, is treated to meet legal and quality 
            standards. It may contain low or moderate amounts of minerals 
            depending on the source of the water (for example, <a href="water_descaling.html#hard">hard 
          or soft water areas</a>). It has usually been  clarified to remove most particulates and treated to ensure no agricultural chemicals or harmful microorganisms are present. This is the major water product 
            with over a billion glasses a day being consumed in the 
            US alone, although most domestic tap water is used for 
            washing, flushing the toilet, and through wastage. Often 
            it is chlorinated, which ensures microbiological safety 
            for long periods of storage and eliminates all risks from 
            otherwise devastating diseases such as cholera and dysentery. 
            Although chlorination has been shown to possibly produce 
            potentially hazardous byproducts, the association between 
            exposure and demonstrable adverse health effects is still 
            unproven. The protection chlorination offers far outweighs 
            this risk. Some countries (e.g.the Netherlands, but not the UK or USA), with high-quality modern distribution systems and low leakage, can distribute tap water without such residual disinfectant, and they still enjoy a lower risk of water-borne disease [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref26.html#r2506">2506</a><a name="r2506" id="r2506"></a>]. Low-level fluoridation of water (for example, by adding 
            SiF<sub>6</sub><sup>2&minus;</sup>) to reduce 
            dental caries is generally regarded as safe [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r966">966</a>a<a name="r966" id="r966"></a>], succeeds in its purpose, and is certainly economically beneficial in saving dental treatment [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1580">1580</a><a name="r1580" id="r1580"></a>]. The health claims for fluoridation remain controversial [<a href="ref11.html#r1048">1048</a><a name="r1048" id="r1048"></a>], but its use is expanding  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1580">1580</a>].  
            Groundwaters containing excessive amounts of 
            fluoride (&gt; 1 mg L<sup>&minus;1</sup>) are widespread [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r966">966</a>b], where the fluoride derives mainly from the dissolution of natural minerals in the rocks and soils. Defluoridation may be necessary [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r966">966</a>c].</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>

However, where the pure water is used for extended periods (e.g., where the sole source of water is obtained by <a href="water_desalination.html#rev">reverse osmosis</a>) and this water is used for cooking (and hence leach ions from) vegetables, there may be mineral shortages in the diet and thought must be given to the provision of additives [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2082">2082</a><a name="r2082" id="r2082"></a>].

          <p>There is an increasing market in bottled water and 
            domestic water processing equipment claiming that the 
            water has considerable health benefits varying from 
            more rapid hydration to cures for AIDS and cancer. Generally, 
            there are no proper scientific trials to prove these 
            claims, only isolated testimonial evidence. Oxygenated 
            drinks have been proposed to improve the immune status. 
            However, a randomized, blinded clinical study [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r968">968</a>a<a name="r968" id="r968"></a>]  was not conclusive, 
            although showing a transient moderate increase in oxygen 
            radicals (using 6 mM O<sub>2</sub>) and signs of  immune response activation. Claims that oxygenated water improves athletic performance have not been proven [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r968">968</a>b]. However, an increase in superoxide radical anion may increase seed germination.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>One factor often used to promote these &lsquo;health&rsquo; waters 
            is supposed greater cellular hydration or ease of hydration. 
            It is unclear whether increased cell hydration is  
            health-promoting. It has been argued that this 
            may be a determining factor in  cancer 
             initiation [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r969">969</a><a name="r969" id="r969"></a>].

            relationship (that is, whether increased cellular 
            hydration initiates cancer or cell aging or cancer or cell aging initiates high 
            cellular hydration) has not yet been established. In both cases, the increased fluidity (greater high-density water) leads to the generation of reactive oxygen species, and the cell becomes less able to repair any damage. More recently (2022) a higher plasticity has been found in some cancer tissues  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref45.html#r4470">4470</a><a name="r4470" id="r4470"></a>].</p>

As oxidative  stress  is  one  of  the  causative  factors  in  the  pathogenesis  of  major  neurodegenerative  diseases,  including  Alzheimer's   dementia,   mild   cognitive   impairment,  and  Parkinson's  disease, it is probable that hydrogen water will be helpful in their treatment. It is also beneficial to cardiovascular function in diet-induced obesity mice   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref43.html#r4287">4287</a><a name="r4287" id="r4287"></a>]. Hydrogen water is reported as having the potential for suppressing dementia in apolipoprotein E4 carriers with  mild   cognitive   impairment    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r3545">3545</a><a name="r3545" id="r3545"></a>]. Most molecular hydrogen introduced into the body by drinking hydrogen water will be expelled in the breath with significant amounts reaching the colon and aiding methanogenic, sulfate-reducing, or acetogenic fermentation processes. Electrolytically produced hydrogen water may be more effective if it contains platinum nanoparticles from the electrode   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r3544">3544</a><a name="r3544" id="r3544"></a>].

            are intended to reduce fluid, mineral (<em>e.g., </em>particularly 
            Na<sup>+</sup>), and energy imbalance due to exercise. 
            The carbohydrate content and <a href="moles_molarity_molality.html#osm">osmolality</a> must both be low 
            to encourage efficient hydration (that is, the drink 
            must be hypotonic (&lt;280 mOsmol &#739; L<sup>&minus;1</sup>) or isotonic (&asymp; 280 
            mOsmol/L)). Na<sup>+</sup> ions (usually as NaCl) are 
            a necessary ingredient as they stimulate both sugar and 
            water uptake in the small intestine and replace 
            material lost by sweat. Hypotonic drinks give more rapid 
            hydration but  contain less sugar and minerals. 
            Chilling improves palatability, so encouraging consumption. 
            Some sports drinks contain &lsquo;power&rsquo; ingredients such as 
            caffeine or taurine, where there is patchy evidence of 
            some sports benefits. These products are usually promoted 
            with testimonials from athletes or sports teams but without 
            double-blinded trial evidence.</p></td>
