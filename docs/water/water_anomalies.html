    <h2><a name="rang" id="rang"></a>The range of anomalous properties of water </h2>
    <p align="left">Water is in a class by itself with exceptional properties when compared with other materials. The anomalous properties of water are those where  the behavior of liquid water is entirely different from what is found with other liquids [<a  href="ref15.html#r1414" name="r1414" title="go to cited reference" id="r1414">1414</a>].<a name="ba" id="ba"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="water_anomalies.html#a"><sup>a</sup></a> The counterintuitive anomalies of water mostly arise from the properties of its <a href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen bonds</a>, that also produce and control the local tetrahedral arrangement of the water molecules. The strength and directionality of the hydrogen bonds control liquid water&rsquo;s thermodynamic and dynamic behavior. If hydrogen bonding did not exist, water would behave non-anomalously as expected from similar molecules. No other 
      material is commonly found as solid (ice), liquid (water), or gas (steam).<a name="bd" id="bd"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="water_anomalies.html#c"><sup>d</sup></a> Frozen water (ice) also shows anomalies when compared with other solids. Although it is an apparently simple and small molecule (H<sub>2</sub>O), it has a highly complex and anomalous character due to its inter-molecular <a title="click for more details" href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen bonding</a> (see  [<a  href="ref16.html#r1530" name="r1530" title="go to cited reference" id="r1530">1530</a>] for example). As a gas, water is one of the <a title="click for an explanation" href="density_anomalies.html#steam">lightest known</a>. As a liquid, it is much <a title="click for an explanation" href="density_anomalies.html#density">denser than expected</a> although possessing a high void space. As a solid, it is much <a title="go for an explanation"  href="density_anomalies.html#melt">lighter than expected</a> when compared with its liquid form.  It can be extremely slippery and extremely sticky at the same time,<a name="bf" id="bf"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="water_anomalies.html#f"><sup>e</sup></a> and this 'stick/slip' behavior is how we recognize the feel of water  [<a  href="ref25.html#r2411" name="r2411" title="go to cited reference" id="r2411">2411</a>]. Water is the most cohesive molecular material in the Universe  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref39.html#r3853">3853</a><a name="r3853" id="r3853"></a>]. Water is highly polar and very responsive to electric fields, including those produced by itself. Many other  water anomalies may remain to be discovered, such as the possible link of water to room temperature superconductivity [<a  href="ref22.html#r2124" name="r2124" title="go to cited reference" id="r2124">2124</a>].<a name="bh" id="bh"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="water_anomalies.html#g"><sup> h</sup></a> An interesting history of the study of the anomalies of water has been published [<a  href="ref16.html#r1542" name="r1542" title="go to cited reference" id="r1542">1542</a>]. Explanations for the water anomalies should be broad enough to cover all the anomalies, with explanations suitable to only a sub-class of anomalies (and not suitable for others) being of interest but little utility.</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">As liquid water is so commonplace in our everyday lives, it is often regarded as a &lsquo;typical&rsquo; 
      liquid. In reality, water is most atypical as a liquid,  behaving like an entirely different material at low temperatures to when it is  hot, with a division temperature of about 50&nbsp;&deg;C. It has often been stated (for example, [<a  href="ref2.html#r127" name="r127" title="go to cited reference" id="r127">127</a>]) that life depends 
      on these anomalous properties of water. The anomalous macroscopic properties of water are derived from its microscopic structuring and reflect the balance between low-density and high-density structures  [<a href="ref37.html#r3627" name="r3627" title="go to cited reference" id="r3627">3627</a>]. </p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The 
      high cohesion between molecules gives it a high freezing and melting point, such that we and our planet are bathed in liquid water. The large heat capacity, high thermal conductivity, and high water 
      content in organisms contribute to thermal regulation and 
      prevent local temperature fluctuations, thus allowing us to 
      control our body temperature more &nbsp;efficiently. The high latent 
      heat of evaporation gives resistance to dehydration and considerable 
      evaporative cooling. It has unique <a href="polysaccharide_hydration.html">hydration properties</a> towards important biological macromolecules (particularly proteins and 
      nucleic acids) that determine their three-dimensional structures, 
      and  their biological functions in solution. This hydration forms 
      gels that can reversibly undergo the gel-sol phase transitions 
      that underlie many cellular mechanisms [<a  href="ref4.html#r351" name="r351" title="go to cited reference" id="r351">351</a>]. <a title="go to 'Water ionization' page"  href="water_dissociation.html">Water ionizes</a> and allows easy proton 
      exchange between molecules,  contributing to the richness 
      of the ionic interactions in biology. It  picks up positive charge when brushing against all materials tested except for air, where it picks up a negative charge [<a  href="ref28.html#r2703" name="r2703" title="go to cited reference" id="r2703">2703</a>]. Also, it is an <a title="go to find more information"  href="pure_water.html">excellent solvent</a> due to 
      its polarity, high relative permittivity (dielectric constant), and small size, particularly 
      for polar and ionic compounds and salts.</p>

    <p>Tetrahedrally-linked hydrogen-bonded clusters are more prevalent at lower temperatures. The presence of a fifth water molecule close to these tetrahedra reduces at lower temperatures, see right [<a  href="ref42.html#r4195" title="go to cited reference">4195</a>]. Both the average O&middot;&middot;&middot;O distances within the tetrahedral clusters and the average O&middot;&middot;&middot;O distances from the  tetrahedral cluster water molecules to the next furthest (fifth) water molecules show different behavior at low and higher temperatures (shown in different colors, and more obvious with the furthest water molecules).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>At 4&nbsp;&deg;C, water expands on <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#density">heating <b>or</b> cooling</a>. This density maximum together with the low 
      ice density results in (i) the necessity that all of a body 
      of freshwater (not just its surface) is close to 4&nbsp;&deg;C 
      before any freezing can occur, (ii) the freezing of rivers, 
      lakes, and oceans is from the top down, so permitting the survival 
      of the bottom ecology, insulating the water from further freezing, 
      reflecting  sunlight back into space, and allowing rapid thawing, 
      and (iii) density-driven thermal convection causing seasonal 
      mixing in deeper temperate waters carrying life-providing 
      oxygen into the depths. The large heat capacity of the oceans 
      and seas allows them to act as heat reservoirs such that sea 
      temperatures vary only a third as much as land temperatures, 
      and so moderate our planet's climate (for example, the Gulf stream 
      carries tropical warmth to northwestern Europe). The compressibility 
      of water reduces the sea level by about 40 m giving us 5% 
      more land [<a  href="ref.html#r65" name="r65" title="go to cited reference" id="r65">65</a>]. &nbsp;Water's high <a title="go to find more information"  href="physical_anomalies.html#ST">surface tension</a> and its <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#melt">expansion on freezing</a> encourage rocks' erosion to provide soil for our agriculture.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="r3b" id="r3b"></a>Notable amongst the anomalies of water is 
      the opposite properties of hot and cold water, <a name="bc" id="bc"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="water_anomalies.html#c"><sup> b</sup></a> with the anomalous

    <p><a name="b" id="b"></a>Four different scenarios have been suggested:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>(<strong>1a</strong>)<strong> The stability limit conjecture.</strong> There is a limit (a singularity) to the mechanical  stability of water at -45&deg;C, 0.1 MPa [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1886">1886</a><a name="r1886" id="r1886"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2995">2995</a><a name="r2995" id="r2995"></a>].

It was suggested that the most straightforward interpretation of the behavior of supercooled water consistent with experimental observations is free of singularities  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r11">11</a><a name="r11" id="r11"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2996">2996</a><a name="r2996" id="r2996"></a>]. This is consistent with supercooled water approaching the structure of a fully bonded random or non-random (e.g., <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>) tetrahedral network  on cooling. This may or may not be linked to a critical point at higher or <a href="ice_xvi.html#a" title="go for more explanation">negative pressure</a>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>(<strong>2a</strong>) <strong>A liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) [</strong><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3753">3753</a><a name="r3753" id="r3753"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3954">3954</a>].  Increasingly, scientists 
      attribute the low-temperature anomalous nature of water to 
      the presence of a metastable <a href="water_phase_diagram.html#crit"  title="go for an explanation">second critical 
      point</a> at about -80&deg;C (under positive pressure, about 180 MPa), when  high-density liquid water and low-density liquid water no longer coexist within the same phase  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2930">2930</a><a name="r2930" id="r2930"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3134">3134</a><a name="r3134" id="r3134"></a>], but split into different phases, separated by a first-order phase transition (i.e., the liquid-liquid phase transition, LLPT).  Using <a href="water_models.html">TIP4P/2005 and TIP4P/Ic</a> modeling, has also indicated that a metastable liquid-liquid critical point occurs under deeply supercooled conditions and that a low-density liquid may nucleate from within a high-density liquid and vice versa <strong>[</strong><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref41.html#r4010">4010</a><a name="r4010" id="r4010"></a>]. Progress of research into  liquid-liquid transitions in various single component substances has been reviewed together with a detailed discussion of how  the existence of two or more liquids (glasses) for a single-component substance  can be physically rationalized [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4152">4152</a><a name="r4152" id="r4152"></a>]. There is still some dispute over the presence of a second critical-point, particularly over whether it should really be called a critical point considering the phases are metastable [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref45.html#r4433">4433</a><a name="r4433" id="r4433"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>(<strong>2b</strong>) <strong>A critical point-free scenario</strong>. Rather  than a critical point, the &quot;<a href="cluster_evidence.html#a"  title="go for an explanation">fragile-to-strong</a>&quot; transition for  supercooled water  is interpreted as the reason for the anomalies in supercooled water [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref4.html#r312">312l</a><a name="r312" id="r312"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It has been established that  scenario <strong>1b</strong> is inconsistent with the evidence and that a <a href="water_phase_diagram.html#crit"  title="go for an explanation">second critical 
      point</a> exists [<a name="r2144" id="r2144"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref22.html#r2144">2144</a> e,f, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref27.html#r2602">2602</a><a name="r2602" id="r4"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2930">2930</a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3202">3202</a><a name="r3202" id="r3202"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3134">3134</a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3420">3420</a><a name="r3420" id="r3420"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3851">3851</a><a name="r3851" id="r3851"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3954">3954</a><a name="r3954" id="r3954"></a>]. The existing data supporting the other scenarios are all consistent with scenario <strong>2a</strong>. Water's anomalies 
      do not require scenario <strong>2a</strong> as an explanation (as agreed by [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4122">4122</a><a name="r4122" id="r4122"></a>] and [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref42.html#r4142">4142</a><a name="r4142" id="r4142"></a>] after an extensive review of the relevant literature). However, it does seem likely [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2947">2947</a><a name="r2947" id="r2"></a>] that there is such a phenomenon and that it could enable the attributed effects [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3954">3954</a>], depending on its precise position in the phase space. The liquid-liquid critical point scenario does not contain any information concerning the structure of the two phases involved. In this respect, it is a somewhat unproductive hypothesis as a sole explanation
      of these anomalies (as the attribution mixes cause with effect, as agreed by others  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1859">1859</a><a name="r1859" id="r"></a>]. The anomalies may simply be caused by the presence of the two phases in proportions determined by their temperature and pressure  [<a href="ref41.html#r4094">4094</a><a name="r4094" id="r4094"></a>]. However, when linked to an equation of state (EOS) that can predict the (low temperature) spinodal <a name="bk" id="bk"></a><a title="click for an explanation" href="water_anomalies.html#k"><sup> j</sup></a> in the presence of the second critical point, it may be used to explain several of water's anomalies [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3954">3954</a>].  Therefore, liquid water may be considered as a locally-inhomogeneous supercritical fluid that fluctuates between a low (mostly tetrahedral expanded) and a high-density (mostly collapsed) liquid states. The former is enthalpy-driven, and the latter is entropy-driven. A description of the structures is <a href="amorphous_ice.html"   title="go for an explanation">given elsewhere</a>. In 2020, there were experimental observations of the liquid-liquid transition in bulk supercooled water under pressure, so reinforcing scenario<strong> 2b</strong> [<a href="ref43.html#r4220">4220</a><a name="r4220" id="r4220"></a>].</p>

    <p>The figure left shows some of the anomalous properties 
      of liquid water that are related to temperature. The graph uses data that have been scaled between 
      their maximum and minimum values within this range (see <a title="go to 'Key water properties; temperature  data' page"  href="data1.html">original 
      data</a>).
      Note, in particular, the different behaviors at high and low temperatures that is in marked contrast to the behavior of simple liquids, whose thermodynamic properties vary in a monotonic manner with temperature.</p>

    <p><sup><a name="a" id="a"> a</a>&nbsp;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether or 
      not the properties of water are seen to be anomalous depends 
      upon the materials used in the comparison and the interpretation 
      of the term 'anomalous'. For example, it could well be argued that 
      water possesses exactly those properties that one might deduce 
      from its structure (see,  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r402">402</a><a name="r402" id="r402"></a>]). 
      The small number of other tetrahedrally interacting liquids (without any hydrogen bonds), such as liquid Si [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1835">1835</a><a name="r1835" id="r1835"></a>], SiO<sub>2</sub>, Ge, C, Sb, Bi, Ga, GeO<sub>2</sub>, GaAs, InSb, CdTe, and BeF<sub>2</sub> have many similar 'anomalies'  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1814">1814</a><a name="r1814" id="r1814"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref45.html#r4402">4402</a><a name="r4402" id="r4402"></a>], as do other materials (also without any hydrogen bonds) where mixed phases may arise, such as liquid Te [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1538">1538</a><a name="r1538" id="r1538"></a>]. Comparisons between water, liquid sodium, liquid argon, and benzene 
      appeared to Franks [<a  href="ref2.html#r112" name="r112" title="go to cited reference" id="r112">112</a>] 
      to indicate several properties given above as not  
      anomalous. However, these materials are perhaps not the most 
      typical of liquids, and elsewhere Franks endorses water's anomalous nature. Also, other liquids (e.g., hydrazine, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, has a melting point of 2&nbsp;&deg;C, and a boiling point of 114&nbsp;&deg;C) are multiply hydrogen-bonded but do not show similar anomalies. Stating that the properties of water are not 'anomalous' but are 'special'  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3219">3219</a><a name="r3219" id="r3219"></a>] does not clarify the situation. This list gives the unusual properties generally 
      understood to make liquid water (and  ice) stand 
      out from 'typical' liquids (or  solids). See [<a  href="ref3.html#r242" name="r242" title="go to cited reference" id="r242">242</a>] 
      for a review concentrating on the non-anomalous properties 
      of water, that is, those that are the 'same' as for other 
      liquids. At higher temperatures (&gt;315 K) the thermodynamic properties of water may be considered close to 'normal' for a liquid [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1638">1638</a><a name="r1638" id="r1638"></a>]. Note that properties that are compared at ambient pressure or along the vapor/liquid line may be seen as anomalous, whereas under  isopycnic (isodensity) conditions no (anomalous) maximum or minimum values may be found (for example, no <a href="thermodynamic_anomalies.html#Cpmin" title="go for the anomaly" >specific heat minimum</a>, <a href="density_anomalies.html#sound" title="go for the anomaly" >speed of sound maximum</a> or <a href="density_anomalies.html#Tcomp" title="go for the anomaly" >compressibility minimum</a> are found at constant water density of 1 g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>; see<a href="water_phase_diagram.html#all"> line on phase diagram</a>). </p>

    <p>It is generally agreed by water scientists today that water is the most anomalous substance [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref27.html#r2653">2653</a><a name="r2653" id="r2653"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3354">, 3354</a><a name="r3354" id="r3354"></a>].

    <p><a name="c" id="c"><sup>b</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some scientists 
      attribute the low-temperature anomalous nature of water to 
      the presence of a <a href="water_phase_diagram.html#crit"  title="go for an explanation">second critical 
      point</a>; an interesting if somewhat unproductive hypothesis as a sole explanation
      (as the attribution mixes cause with effect, as also latterly agreed by others  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1859">1859</a>]). Water's anomalies 
      do not require this as an explanation, although it does seem likely [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2947">2947</a>]. [<a href="water_anomalies.html#bc"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>] </p>

    <p><a name="e" id="e"><sup>d</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The anomalies of water are divided into groups,  but some anomalies may be included under more than one topic, and there may not be a universal agreement for the groupings shown. The 'number' of anomalies depends on which ones are chosen and whether related anomalies (such as the reciprocal variations including molar volume and density) are grouped together or as separate phenomena.

    <p><a name="f" id="f"><sup>e</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is easily shown with two wet panes of glass. If one wet pane is placed horizontally on top of the other, then the panes easily slip over each other horizontally (i.e., they are very slippery) while it being almost impossible to separate the sheets in the vertical direction (i.e., they are very sticky). This phenomenon does not occur with dry panes of glass. A further example of water's stickiness is its use in making sandcastles, whereas its slipperiness is well known on wet floors that are many orders of magnitude more slippery than when dry. Landslides may be triggered by heavy rain, causing slipping at the interfaces between soil particles. The slipperiness of water is used in joints between our bones, allowing their easy relative movements  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref40.html#r3990">3990</a><a name="r3990" id="r3990"></a>]. The stickiness of water ice in the outer reaches of protoplanetary disks enhances the growth of water-containing rocky asteroids and planets  as the particles stick together [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2251">2251</a><a name="r2251" id="r2251"></a>]. This stickiness/slipperiness anomaly is even more extreme if ice cubes are considered. Keep them moving next to each other then they are very slippery; however, if they stop moving them, then they will stick together forever. </p>

    <p>Eels are very slippery due to their water coating. This slipperiness can be neutralized by putting the eel on newspaper. [<a href="water_anomalies.html#bf"><span title="go back to the text">Back</span></a>] </p>

    <p><a name="h" id="h"><sup>g</sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="dgas" id="dgas"></a>Sometimes, apparently unpredictable or unexpected properties of liquid water may be due to variations in the dissolved gas concentrations [<a href="ref20.html#r1948" name="r1948" title="go to cited reference" id="r1948">1948</a>], a factor that is difficult to control and easy to overlook. Atmospheric gases dissolve in water to form nanobubbles and microbubbles, some of which may expand and rise back to the surface. This process causes continuous but somewhat chaotic changes in the gaseous concentrations over significant  periods (&raquo; 100 s) and consequently continuous changes in the hydrogen-bonded structuring within the water [<a href="ref20.html#r1948"  title="go to cited reference" >1948</a>].
