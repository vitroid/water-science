    <p>Although the <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html">icosahedral cluster model</a> can explain the anomalous properties of water, so can other models 
    to varying extents. The most substantial direct evidence for <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html">this 
      model</a> is the agreement with the radial distribution functions.<a name="bg" id="bg"></a><sup><a href="cluster_evidence.html#g"> g</a></sup> The <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr> model was used to generate a radial distribution of the O&middot;&middot;&middot;O 
    distances. <a title="click for an explanation" href="cluster_evidence.html#Fig1">Figure 1</a> compares this radial distribution 
    function with that from the X-ray data at 4&nbsp;&deg;C [<a  href="ref.html#r9" name="r9" title="go to cited reference" id="r9">9</a>], 
    which shows a great deal of <a href="cluster_evidence.html#fine">fine 
      structure</a>. Although the peaks are in the same positions, they 
    are less distinct in the X-ray data indicating the relative movements <a href="cluster_evidence.html#structure">expected of a liquid</a> and the relatively long time taken to achieve the spectrum. There are 
    14 peaks or troughs in the <a title="click for an explanation" href="cluster_evidence.html#Fig1">g<sub>oo</sub>-r plot</a>, 
    plus a further 36 inflection points evident using the first derivative 
    (peaks and troughs in the <a title="click for an explanation" href="cluster_evidence.html#Fig1">&Delta;g<sub>oo</sub>/&Delta;r 
      plot</a>). All 50 positions show correspondence between the X-ray 
    data and the calculated function for <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>, 
    except  between about 7.9 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> and 8.5 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>, where two 
    peaks and troughs in the first derivative X-ray data only had corresponding 
    inflection points in the first derivative <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a> </abbr>model data. If we consider all 50 data, the standard 
    deviation of the differences between the X-ray data and the <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a> </abbr>model data is less than 1%  (0.065 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>). This correspondence, between the model and the experiment, is qualitatively indicative of the presence of the described clusters (or significantly large  fractions of the clusters or partial clusters). Also it  agrees with the 2011 wide-angle X-ray diffraction measurements  [<a  href="ref18.html#r1755" title="go to cited reference" >1755</a>] that were explained as a tetrahedral minority structuring within a more disorganized majority water structuring. There is also good correspondence 
    with the O&middot;&middot;&middot;O radial distribution functions 
    derived from the neutron diffraction data, although this experimental 
    data shows less fine structure [<a  href="ref.html#r36" name="r36" title="go to cited reference" id="r36">36</a>].

    <h2><a name="structure" id="structure"></a>How 
      can a liquid have a structure?</h2>
    <p align="left">When applied to liquids [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r572">572</a><a name="r572" id="r572"></a>], 
      structure, has a different meaning to when it is applied to solids. Liquids are fluids that take the shape of their containers (like gases) but have a  nearly constant volume (like solids), varying little with temperature and pressure. Many properties lie between solids and gases but are difficult to model realistically based on those solid or gaseous properties. In 
      liquid water, the molecules have  translational motion. However, they may travel in relatively unchanging non-crystalline 
      clusters, containing many water molecules, with far lower 
      hydrogen bond disruption than if the molecules traveled entirely independently (as occurs in gases). Additionally, any rotation of such 
      clusters results in the translation of the individual molecules. 
      Although this requires that long-range order is lost, there 
      is still some short-range order. This short-range order extends to at least 8 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> radius even with 
      totally inert, nonpolar, and spherically symmetrical molecules 
      such as in liquid argon [<a  href="ref.html#r95" name="r95" title="go to cited reference" id="r95">95</a>], 
      and up to 15 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> radius (equal to the proposed <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> structure) in the more-ordered supercooled heavy water (D<sub>2</sub>O) 
      [<a  href="ref3.html#r221" name="r221" title="go to cited reference" id="r221">221</a>]. The distance 
      over which this short-range order exists is greater 
      when there is extensive hydrogen bonding as in water. This 
      has been confirmed in aqueous dipole moment calculations where 
      water 10 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> distant still contributes significantly [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r452">452</a><a name="r452" id="r452"></a>]. 
      In simulations, even where the orientation of individual water 
      molecules is rapidly lost, coherent (orderly<a name="bk" id="bk"></a><sup><a href="cluster_evidence.html#k"> k</a></sup>) patterns of extensive 
      hydrogen bonding have been found to exist for periods lasting 
      throughout the simulation [<a  href="ref4.html#r329" name="r329" title="go to cited reference" id="r329">329</a>]. 
      In liquids, the X-ray (and neutron) diffraction pattern corresponds 
      to the time-averaged positions (with exposure times for X-ray 
      studies many orders of magnitude greater than the longest simulation) 
      of the molecules within the volume corresponding to the potential 
      range of this short-range order and so can give valid information 
      as to the preferred structuring of these molecules. An alternative 
      way of looking at this structure is as the average, directionally 
      correlated, network around the water molecules taken from 
      an extremely large pool of liquid water molecules; many orders 
      of magnitude higher than used in simulations. In this context, 
      it is relevant to note that the relative positioning of water 
      molecules around cations such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> remain close 
      to fixed essentially forever but with individual water molecules 
      exchanging with the bulk in less than a nanosecond. Also, hexagonal 
      ice remains firmly ordered and crystalline despite continually
      and rapidly breaking and changing its hydrogen bonding. There 
      is evidence that water structuring may change over periods

      or, in other studies, at least 10<sup>16</sup> times greater 
      than the lifetime of an individual hydrogen bond [<a  href="ref.html#r4" name="r4" title="go to cited reference" id="r4">4</a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r509">509</a><a name="r509" id="r509"></a>, <a  href="ref12.html#r1148" name="r1148" title="go to cited reference" id="r1148">1148</a>]. Another 
      research study shows that disturbances in the structure of single water 
      molecules may last only 50 femtoseconds due to the rapid 
      redistribution of energy amongst the cluster hydrogen bonds 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r750">750</a><a name="r750" id="r750"></a>]. Thus 
      the structure determined for water depends on the time- and 
      size-scales over which it is determined. </p>

    <p>There still seems doubt in the minds of some workers as to whether 
      the radial distribution peak at about 3.7 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> exists [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1788">1788b</a>], 
      despite the need for water molecules at about this distance to give water a higher density than ice. Narten <em>et 
      al.&nbsp;</em> [<a  href="ref.html#r9" title="go to cited reference" >9</a>] first 
      reported this peak and explained it in terms  
      of interstitial water molecules within ice Ih type hexameric 
      boxes. He later put this peak down to artifactual ripples 
      due to the early termination of a Fourier integral [<a  href="ref.html#r58" name="r58" title="go to cited reference" id="r58">58</a>], 
      and therefore this peak has no structural significance. The peak 
      was later again observed in his neutron diffraction data [<a  href="ref.html#r35" title="go to cited reference">35</a>]. 
      The X-ray data have  been reanalyzed, and the peak

      and pressure [<a  href="ref.html#r51" name="r51" title="go to cited reference" id="r51">51</a>]. Four water molecules are generally found roughly tetrahedrally placed in supercooled water at distances about 2.78 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>. The position of the fifth nearest water molecule has been located using simulations and appears maximally at about 3.8 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> and  3.0 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>, in relative amounts dependent on the density [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref11.html#r1055">1055</a><a name="r1055" id="r1055"></a>]. 2009 X-ray evidence has  established   the presence of  fine structure at about 3.4 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> that is not due to artifacts [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref17.html#r1631">1631</a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref18.html#r1788">1788a/c</a>]. It

    <h2><a name="fine" id="fine"></a>Is there a fine structure 
      in the radial distribution function?</h2>
    <p>The data obtained by both <a href="water_methods.html#diff">X-ray 
      and neutron diffraction</a> (for a review, see [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref4.html#r392">392</a><a name="r392" id="r392"></a>]) 
      are subject to uncertainties. The radial distribution 
      function of the oxygen atoms is obtained from neutron diffraction data by subtraction 
      of the hydrogen (deuterium) intensities, thereby giving rise 
      to noise, which, when smoothed, leaves only the most significant features. 
      Also, neutron diffraction data is generally analyzed, ignoring 
      any inherent differences in the water structuring between 
      D<sub>2</sub>O, HDO, and H<sub>2</sub>O and, therefore will 
      produce less detail as these structures differ significantly. 
      Even small differences in the H<sub>2</sub>O content of D<sub>2</sub>O 
      give rise to very different radial distribution functions 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r715">715</a><a name="r715" id="r715"></a>], a problem 
      made worse at low temperatures. Thus, there are reasons to suppose 
      that mixed D<sub>2</sub>O, HDO and H<sub>2</sub>O solutions 
      are <a title="go to find more information"  href="material_anomalies.html#ideal">not entirely homogeneous</a>. 
      It is particularly noticeable that the reported radial distribution functions of the oxygen atoms, determined from neutron diffraction 
      data, differ considerably from each other. Also, the structures 
      of identically produced low-density amorphous ices of D<sub>2</sub>O 
      and H<sub>2</sub>O are not identical, even allowing  a <a title="go to find more information"  href="material_anomalies.html#Isotope">temperature shift</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r940">940</a><a name="r940" id="r940"></a>]. 
      A useful review of these techniques has been published [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r916">916</a><a name="r916" id="r916"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>X-ray diffraction is sensitive to the concentration of electrons. 
      These are assumed to be spherically distributed 
      during analysis, but as the molecule is not spherically symmetrical, clearly this is an <a title="go to 'Water molecular structure' page"  href="water_molecule.html#r2D">approximation</a>. However,  the electron densities around the hydrogen atoms are 
      displaced somewhat towards the oxygen atoms. Also, the electron distribution 
      around water molecules in liquid water appears to be more 
      spherical than in the gas phase [<a  href="ref.html#r90" name="r90" title="go to cited reference" id="r90">90</a>]. Any residual effects that this causes are primarily confined 
      within the nearest-neighbor shell [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r59">59</a>]. 
      The data (for the radial distribution function of water) is 
      not subject to the same amount of noise (and required smoothing) 
      as with neutron diffraction and is intrinsically capable 
      of showing a greater degree of fine structure (see for example 
      the comparison of X-ray and neutron diffraction data given 
      in [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref9.html#r888">888</a><a name="r888" id="r888"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref13.html#r1245">1245</a><a name="r1245" id="r1245"></a>]). Although 
      the fine structure in the X-ray data of Narten [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r9">9</a>] 
      was later interpreted [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r58">58</a>] by Narten as 'ripples' due to the data processing, the key peak 
      at about 3.7 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> has now been <a title="click for an explanation" href="cluster_evidence.html#r3.7">established present beyond 
      question</a>. It seems as if such 'ripples' are of importance, 
      mainly below 2.5 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>. An X-ray scattering experiment 
      at 27&nbsp;&deg;C reported far less fine structure [<a  href="ref2.html#r199" name="r199" title="go to cited reference" id="r199">199</a>], as does a detailed analysis of X-ray diffraction data at ambient temperatures [<a  href="ref20.html#r1971" name="r1971" title="go to cited reference" id="r1971">1971</a>]. However, the data does still show agreement in terms of the broad shells out to the 5<sup>th</sup>. The higher temperature and the greater inherent 'smoothing' may be responsible for the differences, as  work at lower temperatures certainly shows fine structure out beyond 1 nm [<a  href="ref15.html#r1476"  title="go to cited reference" >1476</a>]. In 2011, wide-angle X-ray diffraction measurements with high energy-resolution  resolved a shell structure out to about 1.2 nm [<a  href="ref18.html#r1755" name="r1755" title="go to cited reference" id="r15">1755</a>] even in ambient and hot water but contributed by a minority species.&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="cluster_evidence.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]<br />

    <h2><a name="interstit" id="interstit"></a>Are there interstitial 
      water molecules?</h2>
    <p>The term&nbsp; 'interstitial' can have several meanings. 
      Historically it meant unbonded or weakly hydrogen-bonded water 
      molecules sitting in the empty spaces in a tetrahedrally bonded 
      network, such as <a href="cluster_history.html#int">within the hexameric 
      boxes in ice Ih structures</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r9">9</a>] 
      (this is the meaning that is generally used on this site). 
      More recently, the term 'interstitial'  has been used to describe water molecules 
      that cause the 3.7 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> peak of the oxygen radial distribution 
      function. They may be in this position because they are (i) not 
      hydrogen-bonded, (ii) tetrahedrally hydrogen-bonded 
      but in a separate local cluster, or (iii) hydrogen-bonded within the same local cluster but where there is a considerable bending of the hydrogen
      bonds  involved. These definitions are not necessarily 
      mutually exclusive. It is not the case that interstitial molecules 
      must have no hydrogen bonds; it is possible that 
      such a molecule can have some normal or somewhat distorted 
      hydrogen bonds. The idea of interstitial molecules has  
      been re-introduced using the evidence of some simulation studies 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r66">66</a>], the neutron diffraction 
      finding of interstitial water in effectively-powdered <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html">hexagonal 
      ice</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r154">154</a>], and modeling from water's proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<a href="water_methods.html#NMR">NMR</a>)  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref41.html#r4058">4058</a><a name="4058" id="r4058"></a>]. When 
      liquid water is put under pressure, there appears to be an 
      increase in the interpenetration of hydrogen-bonded networks at 
      about 200 MPa (at 290 K) as evidenced by the increase in 
      the O&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;O nearest molecule separation 
      distances, and O-H stretch vibration frequency with pressure 
      between about 200 to 400 MPa [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r533">533</a><a name="r533" id="r533"></a>]. 
      Both isoelectronic neon and the larger argon atoms can be 
      found in interstitial sites in hexagonal ice, proving they 
      have sufficient size to contain water molecules. <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_vii.html">Ice-seven</a> and <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_viii.html">ice-eight</a> both consist of 
      interpenetrating networks where all water molecules effectively 
      occupy interstitial sites. [<a title="go to top of page" href="cluster_evidence.html#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>
    <h2><a name="cla" id="cla"></a>Support from clathrate structures</h2>
    <p><a name="clathr" id="clathr"></a>There are many examples of the formation

      can form with small molecules including the noble gases (except 
      for helium, which is too small), NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, 
      Cs<sup>+</sup>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4 </sub>[<a  href="ref4.html#r349" name="r349" title="go to cited reference" id="r349">349</a>],

      the (poorly formed) crystals depends on the pressure (generally 
      greater than 1 MPa). Clathrate clusters have also been proposed 
      to contribute to why anesthetics like chloroform 
      and nitrous oxide have their action [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref8.html#r733">733</a><a name="r733" id="r733"></a>]. 
      Dodecahedral clusters containing NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, 
      K<sup>+</sup>, and Cs<sup>+</sup> have also been found in ionized 
      liquid water in the gas phase by mass spectrometry [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r26">26</a>; 
      see also <a href="magic.html">magic number ions</a>]. Such 
      cavity formation is natural in water, increasing the hydrogen-bonding strength in their neighborhood [<a  href="ref.html#r31" name="r31" title="go to cited reference" id="r31">31</a>]. 
      The <a title="go to find more on ionic effects" href="hofmeister_series.html">Hofmeister</a> series, whereby 
      ions affect the stability of proteins in solution by either 
      creating or destroying the structure of water, may be explained 
      in part by how well large ions may sit passively in the dodecahedra, 
      stabilizing <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>,

      proteins in solution also create low-density water [<a  href="ref.html#r29" name="r29" title="go to cited reference" id="r29">29</a>]. Theoretical studies have shown that the full icosahedral cluster (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>280</sub> and, to a lesser but still significant extent, the central (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>100 </sub>core both stabilize the central dodecahedral cluster (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>20</sub> and help stabilize the formation of clusters with contained molecules (i.e., clathrates) [<a  href="ref17.html#r1619" name="r1619" title="go to cited reference" id="r1619">1619</a>]. There are some unusually strong hydrogen bonds, due to cooperativity, in particular (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>20</sub> clusters where the hydrogen bond energy was calculated using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. In liquid water, such hydrogen bonds were found to be more than three times stronger (-82.28 kJ   &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>, 1.42 &Aring; long) than a typical hydrogen bond  [<a  href="ref41.html#r4035" name="r4035" title="go to cited reference" id="r4035">4035</a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The most prominent bands in the experimental vibrational spectra of the low-temperature   water   component are peaked near 200 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> and 3400 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> and resemble those observed in ice and solid clathrate hydrates [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref32.html#r3122">3122</a><a name="r3122" id="r3122"></a>], in agreement with those expected from  the  icosahedral cluster<abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES"> ES</a></abbr>. Using 2-D IR spectra, it has been concluded that transient pentameric rings and their fused structures form major components in liquid water  [<a  href="ref35.html#r3462"  title="go to cited reference" >3462</a>]. These results are consistent with the hypotheses that the population of clathrate hydrates increases with the lowering of temperature, and higher density water may contain collapsed clathrate structures.</p>

Furthermore, TMA solutions increase the solubility ('<a title="go to find more on salting out" href="hofmeister_series.html#b">salt-in</a>') of small hydrophobes [<a  href="ref18.html#r1789" name="r1789" title="go to cited reference" id="r1789">1789</a>] in agreement with the expectation from the <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> model. Together with the slightly larger  tetraethylammonium ion, tetramethylammonium ions are distinctly hydrophilic, whereas the larger  tetraalkylammonium cations are much more hydrophobic   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3143">3143</a><a name="r3143" id="r3143"></a>]. This is likely due to the energetic cost of fitting the larger ions into clathrate-type structures.</p>

    <p> The <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> structure provides about 1.4 dodecahedral sites per molecule 
      for a 0.5-M solution. When higher concentrations of <abbr title="tetramethylammonium">TMA</abbr><sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>&minus; </sup>were used, demanding more dodecahedral sites than those that <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> can 
       provide, 
      the neutron diffraction peak detail was lost. In solutions 
      of <abbr title="tetramethylammonium">TMA</abbr><sup>+</sup>Cl<sup>&minus;</sup>, 
      the chloride had a coordination number to the water of five and 
      the <abbr title="tetramethylammonium">TMA</abbr><sup>+</sup>&middot;&middot;&middot;Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> distance was 5.3 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r39">39</a>]. Both 
      agree with the chloride ion sitting asymmetrically in a nearby 
      pentagonal box to a <abbr title="tetramethylammonium">TMA</abbr> ion situated within a dodecahedron, as this gives a coordination 
      number of five to a dodecahedral face and a <abbr title="tetramethylammonium">TMA</abbr><sup>+</sup>&middot;&middot;&middot;Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> distance of 5.34 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>, given a (reasonable) H<sub>2</sub>O&middot;&middot;&middot;Cl<sup>&minus;</sup> distance of 3.24 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a>. This study [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r39">39</a>] 
      also showed little effect of salt on the structure of 
      water despite the presence of water dodecahedra, which strengthens 
      the argument that such dodecahedral structures are present 
      in pure water. Analysis of the hydrogen bond angles indicates 
      an increased degree of orientational ordering comparable to 
      that occurring in water over 20&nbsp;&deg;C colder [<a  href="ref3.html#r211" name="r211" title="go to cited reference" id="r211">211</a>]. 
      At high salt concentrations, where more than one dodecahedral 
      site is required per 70 water molecules, other sites may 
      arise from tessellated, if distorted, dodecahedra with five water 
      molecules per dodecahedron site, and 6.1 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> between interstitial 
      sites. Alternatively, a <a href="alticos.html">tessellated structure</a> may form from dodecahedra separated by single pentagonal boxes 
      (25 water molecules per dodecahedron site, as may be present 
      in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (<a href="polywater.html#DMSO">DMSO</a>) solutions [<a  href="ref4.html#r342" name="r342" title="go to cited reference" id="r342">342</a>]. This has 
      10.6 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> between large interstitial sites and 5.3 <a href="constants.html#ang" title="Angstrom">&Aring;</a> between large and small interstitial sites. This latter structuring 
      may also be indicated at the phase transitions noticed in 
      concentrated salt solutions (&asymp; 2M) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref6.html#r556">556</a><a name="r556" id="r556"></a>], 
      due to the ions breaking through their solvent-separated hydrated 
      structures. Microwave dielectric relaxation measurements have 
      indicated a critical behavior of water at a mole fraction 
      (x<sub>w</sub>) of 0.83 [<a  href="ref.html#r6" name="r6" title="go to cited reference" id="r6">6</a>]. 
      This can be explained by <a href="alticos.html">tessellated

      extending for tens of nanometers but well within the unstirred 'Nernst'

      consistent with partial conversion to <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#Fig2">low-density

      rationale for the formation of this (interfacial) vicinal water 
      is that the loss of hydrogen bonds at the surface increases the 
      enthalpy so necessitating the water molecules to compensate by doing 
      pressure-volume work. That is, the network expands to form 
      low-density water with lower entropy (see also <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">hydrophobic

      Vibrational spectra have shown the presence of both large 
      clusters (about 240 molecules) [<a  href="ref.html#r18" name="r18" title="go to cited reference" id="r18">18</a>] 
      and cyclic water pentamers [<a  href="ref.html#r48" name="r48" title="go to cited reference" id="r48">48</a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3462">3462</a><a name="r3462" id="r3462"></a>], in agreement with <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>. At low temperatures below 0&nbsp;&deg;C, water is mainly found in hexagons and pentagons with large fused pentameric structures, including the clathrate dodecahedra ((H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>20</sub>), dominating [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3462">3462</a>], in agreement with the <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> structuring that consists only of these clusters [<a href="ref33.html#r3281" name="r3281" title="go to cited reference" id="r3281">3281</a>]. Puckering of the pentamers was found to increase with temperature 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r48">48</a>]. Simulations in 2014 indicate a two-state structure where the low-density state has progressively more pentagonal (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub> rings as the temperature is lowered, increasing to 34% at 200 K and comparing favorably with 50% present in 'pure' <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES </a></abbr>[<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref22.html#r2127">2127</a><a name="r2127" id="r2127"></a>]. In addition, quantum delocalization of hydrogen-bonded protons between oxygen neighbors occurs in the  pentamer, but not the  hexamer  [<a href="ref28.html#r2726" name="r2726" title="go to cited reference" id="r2726">2726</a>]. Such aromatic-like delocalization, within the aqueous pentamers and dodecahedra present in supercooled water, stabilize their structures and contribute to the stability of <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>-clustering, where half the water molecules are within pentamers.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some facts support the presence of some very bent weaker hydrogen 
      bonds in the structure of water. These include (i) the high ice-water 
      energy of fusion, which has been suggested as due to the weakening of a proportion of the hydrogen bonds due to their distortion, and (ii) the vibrational 
      Raman spectra [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r35">35</a>] that indicate 
      a range of weaker hydrogen bonds. Mid-IR pump-probe spectroscopy 
      of HDO in D<sub>2</sub>O has confirmed the existence of two 
      distinct molecular species in water due to their 
      orientational relaxation times as would be expected in the 
      strongly-hydrogen-bonded <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> and weakly-hydrogen-bonded <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr> clusters [<a  href="ref2.html#r189" name="r189" title="go to cited reference" id="r189">189</a>]. In 
      particular, the difference in energy between these forms can 
      be deduced from both the Raman scattering in the O-H stretching 
      region and the O-H overtone infrared region to be about half 
      the energy of a hydrogen bond [<a  href="ref3.html#r210" name="r210" title="go to cited reference" id="r210">210</a>]. 
      Factor analysis of the infrared spectra of H<sub>2</sub>O and D<sub>2</sub>O both show two (and only two) fully hydrogen-bonded species in equilibrium, with their relative concentrations changing with respect to temperature; one predominant at low (supercooled) temperatures and the other at high temperatures, with a 50% crossover at about 30&nbsp;&deg;C [<a href="ref16.html#r1502">1502</a><a name="r1502" id="r1502"></a>]. The transition from <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr> to <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> can explain the high root-mean-square fluctuations 
      of the intermolecular energy in liquid water (7 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>) 
      and the fragile-to-strong <sup><a href="cluster_evidence.html#a" name="ab" id="ab">a </a></sup>transition 
      in supercooled water at about 225 K [<a href="ref11.html#r1040">1040</a><a name="r1040" id="r1040"></a>] and close to the <a title="go to find more information"  href="phase_anomalies.html#r2Cpt">second 
      critical point</a>. This has been confirmed by a molecular 
      dynamics study suggesting that liquid water consists of both 
      high-density and low-density amorphous-like regions with a 
      transformation between them in supercooled water [<a  href="ref2.html#r172" name="r172" title="go to cited reference" id="r172">172</a>]. 
      It has been proposed that the observed heat of fusion (6.0 
      kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>) is due solely to an increase in bond 
      bending going from ice to water [<a  href="ref.html#r49" name="r49" title="go to cited reference" id="r49">49</a>]. 
      The average root-mean-square distortion occurring in <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr> is 13.7&deg;, which gives a very close value (5.2 kJ  &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>) 
      to this observed heat of fusion and agrees with the 
      16&deg; distortions estimated from the 600 cm<sup>&minus;1</sup> libration band [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref.html#r47">47</a>]. High-resolution oxygen K-edge X-ray emission spectra (XES) of liquid water showed two distinct narrow lone-pair derived peaks, assigned initially to tetrahedral and strongly distorted hydrogen-bonded species, as expected from <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> and <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr> structures respectively, with no intermediate structures [<a href="ref16.html#r1557">1557</a><a name="r1557" id="r1557"></a>]. Although these results were  shown to  require a more elaborate explanation [<a href="ref25.html#r2419">2419</a><a name="r2419" id="r2419"></a>], a later analysis reaffirmed the original assignations [<a href="ref34.html#r3366">3366</a><a name="r3366" id="r3366"></a>].

      is 2<sup>130</sup> &#739; 7<sup>12</sup> (curiously this number equals 
      close to 1.50<sup>280</sup>) as determined during the molecular

      expected of 1.5 structural variations per water molecule [<a  href="ref.html#r8" name="r8" title="go to cited reference" id="r8">8</a>]. The icosahedral symmetry of the water clusters fits well with the expected symmetry of disordered systems such as liquids [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3699">3699</a><a name="r3699" id="r3699"></a>].</p>

    <p>In modeling studies, the thermodynamic anomalies of supercooled water appear to occur in a well-defined metastable liquid state separated from the crystal by a substantial free energy barrier [<a  href="ref30.html#r2919" name="r2919" title="go to cited reference" id="r2919">2919</a>]. This is in agreement with the expectation of the <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> model.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The cluster size (about 2.8 nm diameter) is close to that  
      found (about 3 nm diameter [<a  href="ref2.html#r140" name="r140" title="go to cited reference" id="r140">140</a>]) 
      to be the limit below which crystalline components in aerosol

      using a differential mobility particle sizer [<a  href="ref2.html#r141" name="r141" title="go to cited reference" id="r141">141</a>].

A similarly sized cluster (about 2.5 nm diameter) 
      has been found in negatively charged nanodroplets formed from splashed water  [<a  href="ref15.html#r1477" name="r1477" title="go to cited reference" id="r1477">1477</a>]. The internal hydrogen-bonding in such droplets is thought to reduce evaporation and prolong the droplet lifetime. A similarly explained cluster (3.4 nm diameter) has been found as an icosahedral 
      aqueous cluster of thirteen fullerene C<sub>60</sub> molecules 
      [<a  href="ref3.html#r271" name="r271" title="go to cited reference" id="r271">271</a>]. Also, the same length

      The thread of capillary meniscus water has its final &quot;sticking&quot; 
      position at 3.1 nm and breaking when 4.2 nm long and 2.6 nm 
      wide and with &quot;sticking&quot; steps roughly equivalent 
      to the icosahedral water cluster <a href="tabl1.html">cavity 
      positions</a>.  The existence of stable, nearly stationary ES-like states in ambient and supercooled water on the nanometer length scale and  the time scale up to ~ 0.5&ndash;1 ps has been predicted using a mode coupling theoretical approach  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref43.html#r4288">4288</a><a name="r4288" id="r4288"></a>]. A diameter of  about 2 nm has been determined for water clusters in cold water using acoustic phonons (packets of energy) [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref12.html#r1162">1162</a><a name="r1162" id="r1162"></a>].  This is also the minimum diameter for nanodroplets before the homogenous bulk nucleation limit for ice formation  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref44.html#r4394">4394</a><a name="r4394" id="r4394"></a>]. When the structures of ice-amorphized,  supercooled water, approximately-spherical, nanodroplets are examined within '<a href="amorphous_ice.html#nml">No man's land</a>' (&asymp; 150-235 K), it is found that the center of the tiny droplets (N &#8829; 360 molecules of H<sub>2</sub>O) are formed of isotropic low-density water (but not crystalline ice) as might be expected if they were derived from similar to <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3060">3060</a><a name="r3060" id="r3060"></a>]. Similar results have been described by another team [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3336">3336</a><a name="r3336" id="r3336"></a>]. A rationale for the preferable formationof cubic ice from supercooled water is that the hydrogen-bonded clusters present in supercooled water adopt conformations more similar to those in cubic ice [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref37.html#r3667">3667</a>]<a name="r3667" id="r3667"></a>. This would confirm the extensive presence of the <a href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#fig4">all-<em>gauche </em>ten-molecule 
    tetrahedra</a> in the <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a> cluster fragments thought to be formed with supercooling. Using molecular dynamics simulations of TIP4P/2005 water model, it has been found that liquid water's oxygen atoms become more orientationally ordered with cooling and, at temperatures less than 230 K, its orientation is ice-like [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref43.html#r4269">4269</a><a name="r4269" id="r4269"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The proposed structure fits the much-promulgated theory of how 
      sugar molecules interact with water, based on anisotropic hexagonal 
      ice-type interactions [<a  href="ref.html#r5" name="r5" title="go to cited reference" id="r5">5</a>, <a  href="ref.html#r52" name="r52" title="go to cited reference" id="r52">52</a>], 
      but allows sugars a wider range of orientations. Thus, in a <a href="sugar_hydration.html">solution 
      of scylloinositol</a>, each hydroxyl group can  donate and 
      accept a hydrogen bond so long as the <a href="sugar_hydration.html">scylloinositol</a> is situated in one of the 80 chair-form hexagonal sites with different 
      orientations within each 280-molecule cluster. Thus many sugars 
      can create locally stabilized areas within the network of 
      icosahedral clustering. <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> may also be formed as a significant part of the low-density water reported 
      developing in <a href="polysaccharide_hydration.html">gels</a> and at the surface of 
      some <a href="protein_hydration.html" title="more on protein hydration" >macromolecules</a> [<a  href="ref.html#r4" title="go to cited reference">4</a>]. An orientation effect may be expected to strengthen the hydrogen bonding

        mixture model</a>,   rules out persistent structures but does not invalidate <a href="clusters_overview.html#mem" title="click for an explanation" >cluster formation</a> and supports heterogeneities in water. Several molecular dynamics simulations (such as   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref27.html#r2686">2686</a><a name="r2686" id="r2686"></a>] fail to show two-state mixture models, but this may be due to the failure of the models used (<abbr title="Transferable Intermolecular Potential with 4 Points developed in 2005"><a href="water_models.html#tip4p">TIP4P/2005</a></abbr>) to predict many of water's properties. Small-angle X-ray scattering data, taken together with water molecular simulations, showed  no support or need for 2-state heterogeneities in water structure at 25&nbsp;&deg;C [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1520" name="r1520" id="r1520">1520</a>], but this is higher  than the low or supercooled temperatures where  water anomalies are most apparent. A 2016 study combines the two-state mixture model with a continuum model [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref27.html#r2696">2696</a><a name="r2696" id="r2696"></a>]. Small-angle neutron scattering data has been used to  present  a possible explanation of water anomalies that do not involve large-scale heterogeneities or critical behavior [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref34.html#r3322">3322</a><a name="r3322" id="r3322"></a>]. Quantitative X-ray spectroscopy has been shown to be compatible with continuous distribution models of water under ambient conditions [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref37.html#r3670">3670</a><a name="r3670" id="r3670"></a>]. Although this discussion shows that  the two-state 
      mixture model is not necessary to explain the spectra, it fails to rule it out, and their results may be due to structural averaging. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering of water can be used to support either or both the two-state 
      mixture model and the continuum model but both with a major feature of tetrahedral hydrogen bonding [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3720">3720</a><a name="r3720" id="r3720"></a>]. Chandler's several papers denying the <a href="cluster_history.html#outer">two-state 
      mixture model</a> (e.g., [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref22.html#r2144">2144</a> b,c]) have now been proven to be mistaken and misleading [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref22.html#r2144">2144</a> e,f, <a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3420">3420</a><a name="r3420" id="r3420"></a>].
