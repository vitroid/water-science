    <p>Confined  water is found widespread in granular and porous materials and around  and within <a href="intracellular_water.html">cells</a>, <a  title="go for more information"  href="protein_hydration.html">macromolecules</a>, <a title="go for more information" href="nano.html">supramolecular structures,</a> and <a title="go for more information" href="hydrocolloids_gums.html">gels</a>. It has  been reviewed [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref16.html#r1592">1592</a><a name="r1592" id="r1592"></a>, <a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3498">c</a> as has its flow properties [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref37.html#r3601">3601</a><a name="r3601" id="r3601"></a>]. When water is confined, there is a conflict between the energetic minimization of the <a   title="go for more information"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen-bonded network</a>,  interactions with the relatively  large cavity surface, the possibility of quantum coherence (orderliness), and the  fit within the space available. The physical properties and state of the contained water may vary widely depending on the molecular characteristics of the cavity surface, confinement dimensions, temperature, and pressure.  The properties of the confined water are difficult to  predict and may be very different from those of bulk water, exhibiting more significant anomalies. Unsurprisingly, the effect of charged surfaces, such as negatively charged reverse micelles, are much more extensive than those of hydrophobic surfaces, such as droplets in oil [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2783">2783</a><a name="r2783" id="r2783"></a>]. This is particularly true when the confinement is on the nanoscale. When the confinement is about or less than 2 nm, the water cannot form hexagonal or cubic ice crystals such that cooled water turns into supercooled water rather than ice even through the '<a  title="go for more information"  href="amorphous_ice.html#super">no man's land</a>' (150 K &lt; T &lt; 227 K). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The properties of  deeply supercooled liquid are often used as indicative of the properties of liquid water in <a  title="go for more information"  href="amorphous_ice.html#super">no man's land. </a> It is best to take care over such conclusions as the confined water properties can vary widely with its position even within the same confinement. This scenario has been carefully examined [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2613">2613</a><a name="r2613" id="r2613"></a>], but without concluding that such confined supercooled water is likely to be identical to a continuation of bulk supercooled water. This is unsurprising as the space available for the molecular clusters (=&lt; 2 nm) is insufficient for the expected structure of the <a href="amorphous_ice.html#lda">low-density form of water</a> to be formed, particularly if the further space reduction due to surface interactions are taken into account. Proton-charge mobility has been investigated in nanoscopic water droplets [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3187">3187</a><a name="r3187" id="r3187"></a>].  It slows down significantly with decreasing droplet diameter below 5 nm, with the diffusion constant being about 100 times smaller than in bulk water for diameters &lt;1 nm. This probably results from the more rigid hydrogen-bond network in this nanoconfined water. Trace  amounts  of  water,  confined  in  inter-nanoparticle gaps (nanomenisci), show   ice-VII-like characteristics  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r3525">3525</a><a name="r3525" id="r3525"></a>]. </p>

    <h2><a name="phob" id="phob"></a>Hydrophobic confinement</h2>
    <p> Water  at <a   title="go for more information" href="hydrophobic_hydration.html">hydrophobic</a> surfaces is similar to that at the <a   title="go for more information" href="interfacial_water.html">liquid-gas interface</a>. However, confinement prevents movement of the water molecules towards the surface, and <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> dispersion interactions loosely hold the outer molecules in preferred  positions and orientations relative to the surface atoms. </p>
        
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Much theoretical and experimental work has concerned water  in carbon nanotubes [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3431">3431</a><a name="r3431" id="r3431"></a>], made up of a hexagonal lattice of <em>sp<sup>2</sup></em>-hybridized carbon atoms rolled up into cylinders with diameters of about a nanometer. Such  structures are often thought of as <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#philic" title="go to find out more">hydrophobic</a> cylinders, but that can underestimate  the importance of the surface. The carbon atoms provide many van  der Waals interactions in an orderly hexagonal lattice arrangement that varies  between the different nanotube types and  their diameters. Although  uncharged, these surfaces provide extensive pi-electron orbitals that can  interact with and be polarized by, the water molecules to cause effects  significantly different from that expected of a flat and uniform hydrophobic  cylinder. The preferred arrangement of the water molecules within these nanotubes is dependent on their diameter and the temperature and pressure.</p>

    <p>In modeling studies, the penetration of water into nanotubes (see also top right) is modulated by  small changes in the polarity of the wall and the dimensions of the cavity [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1396">1396</a><a name="r1396" id="r1396"></a>]. The cohesive 
      nature of the hydrogen-bonded network may allow water to travel quickly through  such pores, with the molecules leaving the pore pulling through a following stream of water. Thus, sub-micrometer-thick membranes made from  graphene oxide (a mixed <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#philic" title="go to find out more">hydrophilic/hydrophobic</a> material), which are  impermeable to all other liquids, vapors, and gases, allow unimpeded permeation of water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1778">1778</a><a name="r1778" id="r1778"></a>]. Graphene sheets with nanoscale  pores also function well as desalination membranes [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1900">1900</a><a name="r1900" id="r1900"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a name="ice" id="ice"></a>A phase diagram of water within carbon nanotubes has been  proposed for tube diameters up to 1.7 nm. This suggests that there may be at  least nine phases possible within the cylindrical space, including those found  by x-ray diffraction and by simulation. The global maximum freezing point is  found to be for &lsquo;square&rsquo; ice  at 290 K [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1400">1400</a><a name="r1400" id="r1400"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Shown opposite is such a  square ice nanotube formed within a (14; 0) carbon nanotube of diameter 1.11 nm.<a name="ba" id="ba"></a><sup><a href="#a">a</a></sup> Each  water molecule has four cooperative hydrogen bonds, which are more bent than in  hexagonal ice. They also have multiple <a href="hydrogen_bonds.html#b" title="go for more information">van der Waals</a> interactions from the carbon  atoms.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Other ices (for example, pentagonal, hexagonal, and heptagonal nanotubes of water  molecules,  with two donor and two acceptor hydrogen bonds) are formed within  carbon nanotubes of diameters increasing up to 1.9 nm diameter [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1401">1401</a><a name="r1401" id="r1401"></a>].  Conversion between these ices can be achieved by increasing the pressure, such  that the square ice converts to the pentagonal ice at about 200 MPa at about  275 K [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1402">1402</a><a name="r1402" id="r1402"></a>]. The density and self-diffusion coefficients of liquid water in narrow confining nanotubes generally increase with their diameter  but exhibit anomalous behavior in (8; 8) and (9; 9) carbon nanotubes [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref23.html#r2292">2292</a><a name="r2292" id="r2292"></a>]. Water at low density can have a lower diffusion inside nanotubes than water at higher densities [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3431">3431</a>b].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Interestingly,  ambient water flow through carbon nanotubes with diameters of less than 2 nm  exceeds predictions  by more than three orders of magnitude and is substantially higher than using larger diameter pores [<a  href="ref24.html#r2345" name="r2345" title="go to cited reference" id="r2345">2345</a>]. This is probably due to a nearly frictionless surface and the confined space preferring water chains rather than 3-D clusters,  reducing the drag. Single-file water flows down 0.8 nm diameter carbon   nanotubes an order of magnitude faster than within biological water transporters  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref31.html#r3015">3015</a><a name="r3015" id="r3015"></a>]. There is an anomalous  flow of ice-like water through carbon nanotubes (diameter 1.17 nm) at room temperature similar  to that otherwise only occurring in superfluid helium. It requires a slight difference in temperature between the ends of the tube. The ice-like water moves collectively and converts the thermal energy  spontaneously into the directed motion without any energy loss. A pressure difference of up to 25.6 MPa  may be generated from a temperature difference of just 23 K  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3054">3054</a><a name="r3054" id="r3054"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Molecular dynamics calculations have shown that the static dielectric constant of water in carbon nanotubes may increase 10-fold to 700 due to the surface excluded volume allowing an increase in dipolar   fluctuations [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2372">2372</a><a name="r2372" id="r2372"></a>]. The presence of this expected layer of &ldquo;free&rdquo; OH bonds facing the nanotube inner  wall has been found experimentally for liquid water in larger diameter (1.4 - 2.1 nm) nanotubes [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref28.html#r2777">2777</a><a name="r2777" id="r2777"></a>]. However, it has also been reported from capacitance measurements that there is an anomalously low dielectric constant of graphite and hexagonal boron nitride confined water, down to about 2.0 for water confined to about 2.0 nm    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3319">3319</a><a name="r3319" id="r3319"></a>]. There are orientationally ordered surface water molecules that show reduced fluctuations in their collective dipole moment [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref42.html#r4180">4180</a><a name="r4180" id="r4180"></a>]. However, these are active at a molecular level, with finite residence times, it displays time scales similar to more distant water layers.  Water further from these surfaces shows low 'averaged' dielectric due to the presence of this surface water. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The phase boundaries of water confined within  carbon nanotubes show substantial sensitivity to the diameter  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref29.html#r2875">2875</a><a name="r2875" id="r2875"></a>]. Ice was formed,  melting between 105-151&nbsp;&deg;C (pore diameter 1.05 nm), 87-117&nbsp;&deg;C (1.06 nm), -35 and 10&nbsp;&deg;C (1.15 nm), &lt; -80&nbsp;&deg;C (1.24) 15&ndash;49&nbsp;&deg;C(1.44) and 3&ndash;30&nbsp;&deg;C (1.52 nm). Both low- and high-density liquid water states are detected near ambient temperature and above ambient pressure within 1.25 nm carbon nanotubes. In the temperature-pressure phase diagram, the low- and high-density liquid phases are separated by the hexagonal ice nanotube phase [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref30.html#r2925">2925</a><a name="r2925" id="r2925"></a>]. Many other phase diagrams for water, confined in graphene nanocapillaries and single-walled carbon nanotubes,  have been proposed   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref33.html#r3234">3234</a><a name="r3234" id="r3234"></a>], using molecular dynamics simulations.</p>

A slightly irregular two-dimensional square ice ([<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref24.html#r2312">2312</a><a name="r2312" id="r2312"></a>], see left) forms between sheets of graphene 0.65 nm apart under ambient conditions. It has a high packing density and is thought to exist under nano-confinement by many hydrophobic surfaces. This square ice is not the only two-dimensional ice possible as confined water, under pressure between flat plates, 0.85 nm apart, forms a lower density twelve-fold symmetrical quasicrystal made up of mostly five-membered rings in two molecular layers  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref18.html#r1705">1705</a><a name="r1705" id="r1705"></a>]. Three different ice structures were found between 0.8 and 1.0 nm spaced hydrophobic walls. One of these was an interlocked pentagonal bilayer ice (IPBI), with (per unit cell) six pentagons (including those sharing vertices) along the x-direction and two pentagons (without shared vertices) along the y-direction [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2691">2691</a><a name="r2691" id="r2691"></a>]. From first-principle calculations, a phase diagram of double-layer ice as a function of pressure (0.1 MPa -5 GPa) and confinement (0.85 - 1.1 nm width) at 0 K has been predicted [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2907">2907</a><a name="r2907" id="r2907"></a>]. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to compare the liquids,  water, argon, and a simple metallic liquid, in a graphene slit pore. With water, the  monolayer minimum is entropy-driven with large diffusion oscillations, whereas  the liquid argon and metal were energy-driven and entropy-driven with much  smaller diffusion oscillations, respectively  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref45.html#r4401">4401</a><a name="r4401" id="r4401"></a>].</p>

        <p><a name="cice" id="cice"></a>Water confined between hydrophobic molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>; a flat hexagonal sheet-like structure with sulfur-covered faces) and graphene (a flat hexagonal sheet-like <em>sp<sup>2</sup></em>-hybridized carbon structure, see left) gives a flat two-layer crystalline ice phase. This phase consists of two planar hexagonal layers with water molecules directly on top of, and hydrogen-bonded to, each other (three 120&deg; and three 90&deg; angles between the hydrogen bonds; see right where only the oxygen atoms are shown). The   intra-hydrogen-bonding between the layers gives rise to four-membered square rings [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2952">2952</a><a name="r2952" id="r2952"></a>]. The lack of any surface dangling bonds  gives rise to this ice's hydrophobic character. The surface of clean young graphene (see above left) is  hydrophilic with any found hydrophobicity due to the accumulation of surface hydrocarbon impurities. [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2958">2958</a><a name="r2958" id="r2958"></a>]. Approaching water molecules prefer to sit with their oxygen atoms pointing at the center of the carbon hexagons to maximize the van der Waals contacts between the electronic charge density of the O atom and the delocalized p-electron density of the graphene (13.5 kJ &#739; mol<sup>&minus;1</sup>, [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2978">2978</a><a name="r2978" id="r2978"></a>]). Similarly, water confined within narrow slits at supercooled temperatures has been found to show many  2-D phases of ice and amorphous ice  [<a name="r3418" id="r3418"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3418">3418</a>].</p>

    <p>There is evidence that the protons of confined liquid water exist in a novel quantum state when  significant quantum fluctuations in charge  take place along the hydrogen bonds [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1699">1699</a><a name="r1699" id="r1699"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If water is forced into crevices in a hydrophobic/super-hydrophobic surface, the  high surface tension of water-hydrophobic solid interfaces stores energy in the form of interfacial free energy. The spontaneous extrusion of such water out of the nanopores, related to pressure changes, allows the partial or complete recovery of the stored energy  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref28.html#r2701">2701</a><a name="r2701" id="r2701"></a>]. In these hydrophobic confined carbon nanotube systems under pressure,  the transport of water molecules proceeds as a wave motion with frequencies in the terahertz region  caused by the hydrogen-bonding and determined by the carbon nanotube diameter [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref29.html#r2835">2835</a><a name="r2835" id="r2835"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Volumes of water confined within hydrophobic clefts and pores (see <a href="colligative_generation.html#prop">elsewhere</a>) have higher activity than bulk water. The water tends to exit from these volumes creating 'closing' pressures. This evaporation of water induced by confinement between hydrophobic surfaces has a functional role in numerous biophysical phenomena, including hydrophobic self-assembly.    Water expulsion is extremely sensitive to the flexibility of the confining material. If the material is more flexible, the pores preferably empty  the liquid phase [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2927">2927</a><a name="r2927" id="r2927"></a>].   Water bridges can form between  disjointed nano-channels, such as carbon nanotubes, under an applied pressure drop, and these have been studied [<a  href="ref41.html#r4070" name="r4070" title="go to cited reference" id="r4070">4070</a>]. They may connect separate narrow carbon nanotubes that contain single-file chains of water, dependent on the water pressure drop.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Heavy water (D<sub>2</sub>O) binds more strongly within hydrophobic pores than light water (H<sub>2</sub>O), and this may, in the future, lead to a  heavy water concentration system [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r3000">3000</a><a name="r3000" id="r3000"></a>].</p>

    <h2><a name="phil" id="phil"></a>Hydrophilic confinement</h2>
    <p>At hydrophilic surfaces, polar  and hydrogen-bonding interactions with the surface may vary between those  much weaker than water-water hydrogen bonds to those   much stronger [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref39.html#r3849">3849</a><a name="r3849" id="r3849"></a>]. Water will condense  from the gas phase onto glass to give at least four layers of absorbed water [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1403">1403</a><a name="r1403" id="r1403"></a>], with the water  next to the silica   highly structured, [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref33.html#r3211">3211</a><a name="r3211" id="r3211"></a>], dependent on the surface  and  distinguishable from more distant water by infrared [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1404">1404</a><a name="r1404" id="r1404"></a>]  X-ray [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1405">1405</a><a name="r1405" id="r1405"></a>] spectroscopy and molecular dynamics  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref29.html#r2854">2854</a><a name="r2854" id="r2854"></a>]. The negatively-charged silica surface has many isolated, vicinal, and geminal silanol groups, dependent on its history   [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref29.html#r2883">2883</a><a name="r2883" id="r2883"></a>], that strongly hydrogen bond to water. The p<em>K</em><sub>a</sub> of the silanol groups vary between 2.3 to 10.7 as determined along  the capillary wall due to surface heterogeneities [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref31.html#r3016">3016</a><a name="r3016" id="r3016"></a>]. Mineral oxides, such as quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>), sapphire (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), are generally thought to be hydrophilic and well wetted by water. However, fresh faces have a modest hydrophobicity depending on how the surfaces have been prepared. Given sufficient time and an appropriate pH, surface hydroxylation occurs, and the surfaces become hydrophilic  [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref29.html#r2858">2858</a><a name="r2858" id="r2858"></a>]. Even the second neighbors to the surface are considerably  affected due to the competition between the surface water and the effects of  confinement [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1406">1406</a><a name="r1406" id="r1406"></a>]. When  the confinement is less than about 2 nm wide, the viscosity may increase  considerably to over a million times that of bulk water, but this viscosity  increase is not noticed if the confining surfaces are hydrophobic [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1304">1304</a><a name="r1304" id="r1304"></a>]. The surface hydroxyls, on the pore wall, hydrogen bond to the water and control  the distortion of the hydrogen bond network and its surface dynamics [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1408">1408</a><a name="r1408" id="r1408"></a>].

    <p>Variation  of the spacing between any interaction sites on polar cavity surfaces determines  the strength of binding, distribution, and organization of several layers of  water molecules. Sawtooth-like oscillatory forces may be generated as hydrophilic surfaces approach with about 1 nm periodicity, corresponding to units reducing by clusters with a linear width of five hydrogen-bonded water molecules at a time (rather than single water molecule losses)  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2105">2105</a><a name="r2105" id="r2105"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> The adsorption of water to a bare surface involves continuous    structuring changes due to relaxation of the hydrogen-bonding and molecular orientations as the surface becomes covered and further water layers  are added. This can give rise to substantial hysteresis (shown on the right) in structure and properties  on its removal  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1409">1409</a><a name="r1409" id="r1409"></a>]. The adsorption of liquids into hydrophilic nanopores is  due to both capillary flow and surface hydration, followed by the growth of the surface films. This latter mechanism can force out compressed gas from within the pores [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref30.html#r2977">2977</a><a name="r2977" id="r2977"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The adsorption of water vapor into hydrophilic mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub>
    has been studied by  <a title="go for more information" href="water_methods.html#nmr">NMR</a> and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3496">3496</a><a name="r3496" id="r3496"></a>]. Three different water dynamics environments were distinguished and quantified: a neighboring layer up to about 0.75 nm, where strongly bound water molecules exist at the inner surfaces and effectively close the pore diameter; a second less structured layer but still with restricted mobility extending over about a nanometer; and a bulk-like fraction of mobile water that is still somewhat affected. The pore filling is modulated for periodically alternating hydrophobic-hydrophilic pore surfaces   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref35.html#r3497">3497</a><a name="r3497" id="r3497"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Confinement may cause raised or lowered melting points,  dependent on the surface and the space available. Generally, it might be  expected that the raised boiling point and depressed freezing point are  inversely related to the capillary diameter&nbsp;due to the Gibbs-Thomson effect   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1420">1420</a><a name="r1420" id="r1420"></a>]. As examples, cubic ice may form in  4.2 nm diameter cylindrical silica pores at 232 K   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1410">1410</a><a name="r1410" id="r1410"></a>] and water confined in the well-ordered, if narrow (diameter 1.5 nm), pore structure of the silica MCM-41-S-15 does not freeze above 130 K [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2180">2180</a><a name="r2180" id="r2180"></a>]. The possible liquid-liquid coexistence line in supercooled water, below its homogeneous nucleation temperature, has been investigated [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref38.html#r3775">3775</a><a name="r3775" id="r3775"></a>] in wider pore structured MCM-41/C10 (diameter 2.8 nm and total pore volume 0.5 ml/g). The temperature range from ambient down to 120 K, at pressures between 70 MPa and 300 MPa, was used. This work did not support the presence of two liquid phases but provided evidence for the coexistence of liquid water and ice. Surface interactions and the confinement diameter may cause opposite  effects, such as   the ice that forms at 400 K in very narrow pores (0.6-1.0 nm  diameter) in porous glass   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1411">1411</a><a name="r1411" id="r1411"></a>]. Two dynamically different fractions of confined water have been found to coexist within the pores of mesoporous silica particles with pore diameters ranging from 2.1 nm to 5 nm and pore length of about one micrometer.  The two fractions bore similarities to the two ultra-viscous liquid waters (<a href="amorphous_ice.html">HDL, LDL</a>) found in supercooled bulk water and were found to coexist over a range of temperatures [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref36.html#r3573">3573</a><a name="r3573" id="r3573"></a>].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Water may freeze when confined between flat surfaces, so forming the optimally ordered hydrogen bonds required. The confined water  undergoes significant changes in density and viscosity as the surface  separation is varied. For example, in a model, water goes from liquid to solid  and back again as the space, between interacting but non-hydrogen-bonding surfaces,   decreases from 0.58 nm to 0.53 nm and then to 0.47 nm  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1412">1412</a><a name="r1412" id="r1412"></a>]. If unable to form the required ordered structures, it may still undergo wide  fluctuations in density as it attempts to optimize its structure within the  confinement restrictions </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When ice does form at strongly binding or atomically rough  confining surfaces, there may be no room for expansion and a high-density  amorphous ice may result   [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1413">1413</a><a name="r1413" id="r1413"></a>]. Various ices may form in interacting confined space, with a high-density  confined ice (1.2 g cm<sup>&minus;3</sup>) formed from two helices and crystallizing  at ambient temperature in AlPO<sub>4</sub>-5 zeolite 0.73 nm diameter micropores  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1407">1407</a><a name="r1407" id="r1407"></a>]. Both cubic and amorphous ices can form at strongly binding silica surfaces at  low temperatures [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1406">1406</a>]. However, rather than forming ice  within confinement, liquid water in confined spaces may leave the confinement  on freezing to crystallize freely external to the cavity, so long as  the gas phase can easily  replace them under the ambient pressure  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref14.html#r1399">1399</a><a name="r1399" id="r1399"></a>].

    <h2><a name="mixed" id="mixed"></a>Mixed confinement</h2>
    <p>An important form of biological confinement is where there are both hydrophilic and hydrophobic effects like those existing in the binding sites of proteins. Hydrophobic pores terminated by hydrophilic binding sites have been investigated [<a name="r3484" id="r3484"></a><a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref35.html#r3484">3484</a>]. A good guest for such molecular pores meets the following criteria: (a) the hydrophilic atoms in the guest are complementary to the hydrogen-bonding sites at the end of the cavity in terms of orientation, distance, and number; and (b) the hydrophobic group of the guest is sufficiently large  to expel all of the cavity water molecules and maximize the hydrophobic effect, but not so large to introduce steric repulsion with the cavity walls.</p>
