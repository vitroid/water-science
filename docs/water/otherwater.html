    <h2><a name="IE" id="IE"></a>I<sub>E</sub></h2>
    <p>More recently than polywater, I<sub>E</sub> (ice formed 
      by electric field forces) crystals (mm &#739; 100 nm diameter) 
      have been proposed to form around ions due to their electric 
      field [<a  href="ref2.html#r124" name="r124" title="go to cited reference" id="r124">124</a>, <a  href="ref2.html#r125" name="r125" title="go to cited reference" id="r125">125a c e</a>]. 
      It is also proposed that these 'spherically symmetrical crystals' 
      can be broken by shaking to seed further crystal formation. However, this seems more likely to cause the loss of water 
      molecules from the surface (peeling) rather than the release 
      of fragments. The ions must be dilute (&lt; 10<sup>&minus;5</sup> M) to prevent ions 'interacting' (reducing the electric field 
      gradient) before crystals have time to form. The crystals 
      are proposed to have a 20% lower dielectric than water. These 
      I<sub>E</sub> crystals are now thought to be utterly artifactual, 
      with the term 'crystals' now being replaced by 'water clusters'. 
      Even with this change, <span class="style6">these 
        theories have not been confirmed [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref2.html#r125">125b d</a>] 
        and are not generally accepted</span>, and no <a href="water_phase_diagram.html" title="go to a description of water's phases">ice 
      phase</a> is formed above 0&nbsp;&deg;C below 632 MPa. &nbsp;However, the presence of extensive hydrogen-bonded  clusters in less-than-pure water containing additional hydrophobic solutes is  quite reasonable.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>An 'ice' (presented as pure water that is solid at ambient temperatures and pressures but with no structural information) was apparently prepared at room temperature. This 'preparation' used a substantial sequence of filtration steps through glass filters  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref22.html#r2166">2166</a><a name="r2166" id="r"></a>], or  other similar methods from the same authors. These works are also published in Pollack's journal, but the conclusions appear to be due to dissolved impurities that apparently were not subjected to  full and proper analyses. [<a title="go to top of page" href="#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>
    <h2><a name="hho" id="hho"></a>HHO</h2>
    <p>An 'HHO' material produced from 
      water by electrolysis that is supposedly different of the 
      expected electrolytic mixture has been proposed.<sup><a href="#b" name="bb" id="bb">a</a></sup> This process supposedly breaks the (inviolable) laws of thermodynamics 
      and is backed by a paper full of scientific and numerical 
      errors [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r938">938</a><a name="r938" id="r938"></a>]. 
      The claims for this material (that is, HHO) should be 
      examined with great care and are now correctly reported as totally erroneous [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r938">938</a>b], although this is disputed [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref10.html#r938">938</a>c].&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>]</p>
    <h2><a name="neo" id="neo"></a>Neowater</h2>
    <p>An interesting development was the sale of 'neowater' 
      (<a href="http://star.tau.ac.il/&asymp; eshel/water%20complexity.html" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin21" onclick="newWin('otherWin21')">water containing a minute amount of nano-sized, 10-50 nm, 
       barium titanate particles</a>) for various biotechnological processes. 
      It was suggested that the particles organize the surrounding 
      water and stabilize gaseous <a  title="go for more information"  href="nanobubble.html">nanobubbles</a> (more properly called nanocavities) resulting in the change in the liquid's properties. 
      Scientific support for this was beginning to appear [<a  href="ref12.html#r1129" name="r1129" title="go to cited reference" id="r1129">1129</a>, <a  href="ref12.html#r1172" name="r1172" title="go to cited reference" id="r1172">1172</a>], when the company ceased trading.&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>] </p>
    <h2><a name="dec" id="dec"></a>Clustered and 'declustered' water </h2>
    <p><a name="decluster" id="decluster"></a>There has been an explosion 
      of Internet sites and sales outlets concerned with 'declustered' 
      or oxygenated water production. Generally, these concern  promoting 
      and selling relatively expensive water preparations for their 
      (supposed) health benefit. These appear to be related to Lorenzen's 'microclustered' 
      water [<a  href="ref2.html#r164" name="r164" title="go to cited reference" id="r164">164</a>] or Hayashi's 
      'microwater' [<a  href="ref2.html#r111" name="r111" title="go to cited reference" id="r111">111</a>]. 
      Lorenzen prepared such water by passing steam across a magnetic 
      field (using magnetite), 
      exposing it to light/radiation with a wavelength between 610 
      nm and 1 mm (preferably monochromatic at 640 nm) and adding 
      materials such as 3 - 4 <a href="constants.html#ppm">ppm</a> metasilicate, up to 1% yeast cells 
      and gas under pressure. His patents claim such water may be 
      diluted by between 10<sup>3</sup> and 10<sup>20</sup> times. 
      A similar product (Willards water) also uses silicates 
      and surfactants [<a  href="ref2.html#r193" name="r193" title="go to cited reference" id="r193">193</a>], 
      whereas <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penta_Water" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin12" onclick="newWin('otherWin12')">'Penta' 
      water</a> uses acoustic cavitation and oxygen saturation 
      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref5.html#r496">496</a><a name="r496" id="r496"></a>]. Hayashi 
      prepared his water by electrolysis <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="#b">a</a></sup> using the reduced and oxidized streams for different purposes. 
      Although cluster size can be determined from the shift in 
      the <sup>17</sup>O NMR resonance signal in line with its reduction 
      with increasing temperature, in some cases it seems to have 
      been determined by means of changes in the width (at half 
      peak height) of the <sup>17</sup>O NMR resonance signal from 
      above 100 Hz to below 100 Hz. Other  conditions being equal, this width is expected to measure the strength of the  clustering as motionally-hindered water has faster relaxation kinetics and  should give a greater <sup>17</sup>O NMR resonance signal width (for example, the width  also decreases with increasing temperature). However, these samples are not 
      pure water samples as they have high (supersaturated) gas 
      concentrations and may contain other additives. The widths 
      do not appear to change reproducibly as Hayashi reports a 
      width for impure water of 105 Hz, but Lorenzen reports the 
      width for distilled and triple distilled water as higher at 
    130 Hz and 115 Hz, respectively. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the data reported 
      by Lorenzen and Hayashi is sparse and does not include any 
      statistical data or precise experimental conditions. Also, 
      there does not seem to be sufficient other data reported in the 
      literature concerning the effect of solutes on the width of 
      this resonance or its reproducibility. Other uncontrolled 
      factors, such as pH, will also have a major effect. Independent NMR 
      analysis      [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref16.html#r1516">1516</a><a name="r1516" id="r1516"></a>] fails to confirm any correlation with 
      structure. Nor is there any unanimity on what cluster size 
      any reduction in the width might indicate. Other unanswered 
      questions concern (a) whether it is the strength or extent 
      of the hydrogen-bonding that is important, (b) if the extent is 
      important, is it the mean number of hydrogen bonds that each water 
      molecule participates in or the mean cluster size of fully 
      satisfied hydrogen-bonded water molecules that is important? 
      (c) if strength is important, is it the mean strength of all 
      the bonds around a water molecule or only the strongest of 
      these? (d) what is the effect of the distribution of hydrogen 
      bond strengths (or extents)? and (e) how long do any effects 
      last? More importantly, 
      controlled clinical trials are lacking so that all sales patter 
      extolling the health-giving virtue of such water involves 
      the (scientifically irrelevant and fundamentally biased) use of 
      testimonials.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the light of the increased promotion of 'special' water 
      preparations, it is important to take notice that there are 
      definite and proven health benefits from simply <a href="hydration_health.html">drinking 
      more water</a> (within reason).&nbsp;[<a title="go to top of page" href="#top"><span class="style16">Back to Top&nbsp;</span><img src="images/rtup.gif" border="0" alt="to top of page" width="13" height="12" /></a>] </p>
