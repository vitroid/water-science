    <p>Most solids expand and become less dense when heated. <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html">Hexagonal</a>, <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="cubic_ice.html">cubic</a>, <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_xvi.html">ice XVI,</a> and <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="amorphous_ice.html">low-density amorphous ice</a> all  become denser at low temperatures [<a href="ref38.html#r3783" name="r3783" title="go to cited reference" id="r3783">3783</a>a].  However, all 
    expand slightly with cooling at all temperatures below about 70 K [<a href="ref3.html#r209" name="r209" title="go to cited reference" id="r209">209</a>a] with a minimum 
    thermal expansivity at about 33 K (expansion 
    coefficient (&alpha;) &asymp;  -0.000003 K<sup>&minus;1</sup>). This low-temperature expansion appears to be due 
    to alteration in the net bending motion of three tetrahedral <a title="go to 'Hydrogen bonding in water' page"  href="water_hydrogen_bonding.html">hydrogen-bonded</a> molecules with temperature, 
    as higher frequency modes are reduced [<a href="ref3.html#r209" title="go to cited reference">209</a>b]. This phenomenon is similar but unrelated  to the <a href="density_anomalies.html#density">maximum density anomaly</a> that occurs in liquid water. Interestingly, the density maximum for hexagonal ice is  about 72 K at ambient pressure, and this is the maximum temperature for its catalyzed phase transition to <a  title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_xi.html">ice XI</a>.                    Over the range, 80-160 K, the density of high-density (<abbr title="High density amorphous ice"><a href="amorphous_ice.html#hda"  title="go to find out more on high density amorphous ice">HDA</a></abbr>)  amorphous ice decreases on isobaric heating  above &asymp; 0.35 GPa but increases at lower pressures  [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1688">1688</a><a name="r1688" id="r1688"></a>].
    </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A further ice density anomaly concerns the high molar volume of heavy water <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html">hexagonal</a> ice  compared with that of light water [<a  href="ref4.html#r382" name="r382" title="go to cited reference" id="r382">382</a>] (see above right). A lower density is usually expected for such isotopic changes due to the intramolecular vibrational O&ndash;H stretching modes [<a  href="ref29.html#r2882" name="r2882" title="go to cited reference" id="r2882">2882</a>] of the hydrogen bonds. Similar anomalous behavior is expected in ices Ic, III, V, IX, XII, XIII, XIV, and XVI.</p>

    <p>It is usual for liquids (even hydrogen-bonded liquids like ethanol and hydrogen peroxide) to contract on freezing and expand on melting (e.g.,  liquid oxygen shrinks 19% on freezing, and molten lead shrinks 6.4% on freezing). 
      This is because the molecules are in fixed positions within the 
      solid but require more space to move around within the liquid. Other materials that expand on freezing are  silicon, gallium, germanium, antimony, and bismuth. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When water freezes at 0&nbsp;&deg;C, its <a title="click for an explanation" href="density_anomalies.html#dens">volume increases</a> by about 9% under atmospheric pressure; therefore, ice floats on water (see above). If the melting 
      point is lowered by increased pressure, the increase in volume 
      on freezing is even more significant (for example, 16.8% at -20&nbsp;&deg;C [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r561">561</a><a name="r561" id="r561"></a>]). 
      The molar volumes of ice and water along the melting point curve [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r561">561</a>] are shown right. The expansion of ice, compared with liquid water, is why erosion is caused by the cracking of rocks when  contained moisture freezes</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The   <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html">ice (Ih)</a> structure is open 
      with a low packing efficiency. All the water molecules 
      are involved in four straight, tetrahedrally-oriented hydrogen 
      bonds; for comparison, solid hydrogen sulfide has a face-centered, 
      cubic closed packed structure with each molecule having twelve 
      nearest neighbors [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref2.html#r119">119</a><a name="r119" id="r119"></a>]. 
      On melting, some of these <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="hexagonal_ice.html">ice (Ih)</a> bonds break, others bend, and the structure undergoes a partial 
      collapse. Other tetrahedrally arranged solids such as 
       silica (responsible for the Earth's crust floating on the 
      outside of our planet) behave similarly.  This is different from most solids, where the extra movement available 
      in the liquid phase requires more space and therefore melting 
      is accompanied by expansion. <a name="stretch" id="stretch"></a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In contrast, it should be noted that the high-pressure ices (<a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_iii.html">ice <span class="style1">III</span></a>, <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_v.html">ice <span class="style1">V</span></a>, <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_vi.html">ice <span class="style1">VI</span></a>, and <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_vii.html">ice <span class="style1">VII</span></a>) all <a title="go to find more" href="water_density.html#lid">expand 
      on melting</a> to form liquid water.&nbsp;The expansion in volume when going from liquid to solid, under ambient 
      pressure,  causes extensive tissue damage in biological organisms 
      on freezing.&nbsp;In contrast, freezing liquid water under high pressure to the more dense <a title="go to find more on structure"  href="ice_vi.html">ice <span class="style1">VI</span></a>  causes ilittle structural damage [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref6.html#r535">535</a><a name="r535" id="r535"></a>]. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Due to the expansion on freezing, an interesting phenomenon is 
      the formation of <a href="http://www.its.caltech.edu/%7Eatomic/snowcrystals/icespikes/icespikes.htm" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin33" onclick="newWin('otherWin33')">thin

  <p>As sea ice floats on water, displacing its own weight of water, it is often saidt that when such ice melts (caused by global warming), the water level  should not rise.<sup> <a href="density_anomalies.html#j" name="bj" id="bj">j</a></sup> However, as the ice melts to give fresh (not salty) water, which is less dense than the salty sea  water, a very small rise in sea level does occur. The 750 km<sup>3</sup> of ice melted each year from our polar ice sheets gives a 50 &mu;m rise in the oceans [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref17.html#r1662">1662</a><a name="r1662" id="r1662"></a>]. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Only about 11% of an iceberg is above water as ice has a density of about 917 
      kg &#739; m<sup>&minus;3</sup> plus a bit from contained dirt and algae but minus a bit from contained air bubbles. In contrast,  seawater has a density of about 1028  
      kg &#739; m<sup>&minus;3</sup>. Therefore 1000 m<sup>3</sup> of seawater will balance about 1121 m<sup>3</sup> of ice, and 121/1121 or 11% of the iceberg is above sea level. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The liquid is also denser than the ice is also found for NH<sub>4</sub>F, which has similar solid structures to water.</p>

      <p>It is generally assumed that ice skating (or skiing) does not 
        produce sufficient pressure to lower the melting point significantly, 
        except at very sharp edges or involving powdered ice on the 
        ice surface. The increase in slipperiness is usually generated 
        by frictional heating, perhaps initially involving the <a href="http://www.bushwalking.org.au/FAQ/FAQ_MeltBelowZero.htm" title="opens new site in a pop-up window"   target="otherWin9" onclick="newWin('otherWin9')">ultra-thin

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The underlying slipperiness of water and ice can be explained by the <a href="cluster_evidence.html#2phas">two-state model</a> [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref19.html#r1859">1859</a><a name="r1859" id="r1859"></a>] that aids the formation of a slipping plane on confinement. The slipperiness of wet surfaces is most significant when one surface is <a href="hydrophobic_hydration.html#philic" title="go to find out more">hydrophilic</a> and the other hydrophobic, and least significant when both surfaces are hydrophilic [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref21.html#r2085">2085</a><a name="r2085" id="r2085"></a>].</p>

      <p><a name="regelation" id="regelation"></a>Regelation (the phenomenon of melting under pressure and freezing again when the pressure is reduced, such as the movement of a wire through an ice cube  that refreezes again after the wire's passage) is often cited as due to the lowering of the melting point of ice under pressure. However, the pressure required for lowering the melting point using a weighted wire may be greater than that provided, and this phenomenon is aided by the heat transfer down the wire, causing localized thawing.  However, note  that  when  ice is compressed in the absence of liquid water,  the melting temperature is lowered twelve times more than if the pressure  is exerted uniformly on water plus ice. <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="density_anomalies.html#k"> k</a></sup> The melting of ice under pressure aids glacier motion. Two-dimensional ice crystals may develop in water confined between graphene and muscovite mica. These form a quasi-liquid layer of water under a critical pressure beyond 6 GPa    [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref32.html#r3144">3144</a><a name="r3144" id="r3144"></a>].</p>

      <p>An interesting question concerns what would happen to water, cooled below 0&nbsp;&deg;C, within a vessel that cannot change its volume. If the increase in volume on 
        freezing is prevented within an isochoric freezing system (a constant volume chamber capable of withstanding the pressures that develop in the system, with minimal deformation [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref34.html#r3361">3361</a><a name="r3361" id="r3361"></a>]), an increased pressure of up to 25 MPa 
      may be generated in the unfrozen water pipes; easily capable of bursting them in Winter<sup><a href="density_anomalies.html#b" name="bb" id="bb">b</a></sup>. If ice forms, its increased volume causes an increase in pressure which would lower the freezing point at least until it reaches the lowest melting point (&minus;21.985&nbsp;&deg;C)  at 209.9 MPa.<sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="density_anomalies.html#e"> e</a><a name="be" id="be"></a></sup> A thermodynamic analysis concludes that ice nucleation cannot happen above &minus;109&nbsp;&deg;C during isochoric cooling [<a href="ref11.html#r1053">1053</a><a name="r1053" id="r1053"></a>], which is close to the upper bound of the realm of deeply supercooled water (&minus;113&nbsp;&deg;C), so it is unclear if the ice would ever freeze in such an unreal system.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Within a filled and sealed 
        fixed volume, melting ice may result in a superheated state 
        where the metastable iso-dense liquid water is stretched, due to its cohesiveness.

        pressure.

    <p> The high density of liquid water is due mainly to the cohesive

        volume and ensures a relatively high density,  partially compensating 
        for the open nature of the hydrogen-bonded network. 
        Its density, however, is not as great as that of tightly packed, 
        isoelectronic, liquid neon (1207 kg m<sup>&minus;3</sup> at 27 K, 
        with molar volume 92.8%   of water). It is usual for liquids 
        to expand when heated at all temperatures. Liquid water increases its density (&rho;) on heating from supercooled temperatures up to 3.984&nbsp;&deg;C. </p>

    <p>The density maximum <a href="density_anomalies.html#l" name="bl" title="click for an explanation" id="bl"><sup>l</sup></a> (and molar volume minimum) is brought 
        about by the opposing effects of increasing temperature, causing 
        both structural collapses that increase density and thermal

      <p>The density maximum ensures that the bottoms of freezing freshwater lakes generally remain at about 4&nbsp;&deg;C and unfrozen (see Figure below left). The change in density with temperature causes an inversion in cold water systems as the temperature is raised above about 4&nbsp;&deg;C. Thus in water below  about 4&nbsp;&deg;C, warmer water sinks, whereas when above about 4&nbsp;&deg;C, warmer water rises. As the water warms up or cools down through 4&nbsp;&deg;C, this process causes considerable mixing (see the heating and cooling curves below  right [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref27.html#r2611">2611</a><a name="r2611" id="r2611"></a>]) with beneficial consequences such as an increased gas exchange.

      <p>The structure of the surface of water generates much controversy and presents a confusing picture. However, thermodynamics and experimental evidence both suggest that,  at lower temperatures and in contrast to  other liquids, the surface in contact with the air is denser than the bulk liquid. Thermodynamics (see <a title="opens another page" href="interfacial_water.html#c">elsewhere</a>) can be used to derive <img src="images/stt14.gif" alt="(dA/dV)TPn" width="49" height="39" align="middle" />; a measure of the difference in density between the surface density and the bulk density. This shows that surface water density varies less with temperature than the bulk at low temperatures and equals it at 3.984&nbsp;&deg;C. The refractive index of the  water surface at 22&nbsp;&deg;C is  higher than that of the bulk and opposite in behavior to other liquids (for example, ethanol) [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref15.html#r1482">1482</a>]. Thus, this surface water behaves like water at a lower temperature and has a higher density. <sup><a title="click for an explanation" href="density_anomalies.html#i">i</a><a name="bi" id="bi"></a></sup> Related to this phenomenon are the anomalously fast and efficient intermolecular vibrational energy  transfer processes at aqueous interfaces [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref19.html#r1816">1816</a><a name="r1816" id="r1816"></a>].

    <p>Sound is a longitudinal pressure wave, whereby the energy propagates as deformations in the media. The molecules 
          then return to their original positions and are not propagated. 
          The propagation of a sound wave depends on the transfer of 
          vibration from one molecule to another. Transverse waves may form at the surface of liquid water (ripples, ocean waves) but do not persist in bulk liquid water.</p>

    <p>NMR spin-lattice relaxation time (<em>T<sub>1</sub></em>, also known as the longitudinal proton relaxation time) depends on the degree of 
        structure. This relaxation time is the time required to establish thermal equilibrium after subjection to a magnetic field. As the water cluster <a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#Fig2">equilibrium</a> shifts towards a stiffer, tetrahedrally organized structure 
        (for example, <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr>)

        This effect can be partially reversed by increasing the pressure, 
        which reduces the degree of structure.

    <p align="left">The refractive index of water (&lambda; = 589.26 nm) rises from an estimated 1.33026 at -30&nbsp;&deg;C to 
        a maximum value at just below 0&nbsp;&deg;C (1.33434) before falling 
        ever increasingly to 1.31854 at 100&nbsp;&deg;C [<a href="ref4.html#r310" name="r310" title="go to cited reference" id="r310">310</a>]. 
        This may be explained by the mixture model [<a href="ref.html#r60" name="r60" title="go to cited reference" id="r60">60</a>] 
        applied to the change from <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> to <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr> as the temperature rises; <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> possessing a lower refractive index than <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>. 
        Most of the effect is due to the <a title="go to find more information"  href="density_anomalies.html#density">density 
      difference</a> between <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> and <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>. 
        Higher density produces a higher refractive index such that the 
        refractive index temperature maximum lies close to the density 
        maximum, with the slight difference due to the slightly different 
        effect of temperature on the specific refractions of <abbr title="Expanded icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#ES">ES</a></abbr> and <abbr title="Collapsed icosahedral water cluster structure"><a title="go to 'Water clusters' page"  href="icosahedral_water_clusters.html#CS">CS</a></abbr>.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Water is one of the lightest gases but forms a <a title="go to density anomaly" href="density_anomalies.html#density">dense liquid</a>. The volume change is the greatest known (except for metals at very high temperatures) at 1603.6 fold, at the boiling point and standard atmospheric pressure. The reason for this is the <a href="phase_anomalies.html#Bpt">high boiling point </a>of liquid water for such a small molecule and hence the large volume of gas produced. Compare this with a more typical value of about 800 fold (e.g., O<sub>2</sub> 804 fold).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This   volume change allows water to be of great use in the steam generation of electrical power. Sudden and extreme water heating can give rise to violent steam explosions such as those occurring when volcanic lava meets seawater or the explosively spread fire caused by attempting to extinguish a hot oil kitchen fire by throwing water onto it (see right). </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The substantial increase in volume on vaporization allows fine water mists to be used in fighting fires by displacing the oxygen with water vapor [<a title="go to cited reference"  href="ref25.html#r2456">2456</a><a name="r2456" id="r2456" ></a>]. </p>

This difference is down to the viewpoint and different  theoretical expectations. Water's compressibility is unexpected, either being greater than expected due to water's open structure or less than expected (despite its open structure) due to the cohesive

    <p><a name="i" id="i"></a><sup>i</sup> A higher refractive index indicaties a higher density or a greater hydrogen bond strength (at equal density). Structured water has higher specific refraction and refractive index for its density [<a title="go to cited reference" href="ref.html#r60">60</a>], but the effect of density changes on the refractive index outweighs that of the specific refraction differences due to water structuring; thus, ice has a density of 91.7% of water and refractive index of 98.2% of water. The thermodynamics confuses this view as at    22&nbsp;&deg;C thermodynamic arguments suggest the surface is less dense than the bulk (if somewhat<a title="go for further information" href="physical_anomalies.html#e"> less so than other liquids</a>).
